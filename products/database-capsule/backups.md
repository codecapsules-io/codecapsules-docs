# Backups

Protect your data by creating manual backups and setting up automatic backup schedules for your Data Capsules.

## Manual Backup

Trigger a manual backup of your Capsule by clicking the **Backup** button in the **Manual Backup** section.

## Automatic Backups

Toggle the switch next to the backup schedule you want to use:

- **Daily Backup:** Creates backups every day
- **Weekly Backup:** Creates backups every week
- **Monthly Backup:** Creates backups every month

Code Capsules retains backups based on your selected schedule and automatically deletes older backups as new ones are created.

## View Backups

The **Backups** section in the right-hand panel lists all completed backups. You can restore and manage backup files here.

Backup storage costs $0.50/GB.
