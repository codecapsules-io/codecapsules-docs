* **High CPU Usage** - Alert when CPU usage exceeds 80%
* **High Memory Usage** - Notify when memory usage exceeds 80%
* **High Data Usage** - Alert when data usage exceeds 80%
* **CPU Throttle** - Notify when CPU is being throttled

Use "Enable All" or "Disable All" buttons to quickly configure all notifications, then click "Save Preferences" to apply your changes.
