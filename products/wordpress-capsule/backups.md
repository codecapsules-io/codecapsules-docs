# Backups

WordPress stores content in two locations: the MySQL database (posts, pages, users or settings) and file storage (themes, plugins or uploaded media). Production WordPress requires backups for both locations to ensure complete site restoration.

To configure backups for your WordPress site:

- **Database Backups:** See the [Database Capsule backup documentation](/products/backups) to configure retention and test restoration.
- **Storage Backups:** See the [Storage Capsule backup documentation](/products/storage-capsule/backups) to manage file backup settings.
