# Backups

WordPress stores content in two locations:

- The MySQL database (posts, pages, users, and settings)
- The file storage (themes, plugins, and uploaded media)

WordPress production sites require backups for both locations to ensure complete site restoration.

Code Capsules provides infrastructure-level backups through Database and Storage Capsules. Use our guides to set up backups for your WordPress site:

- **[Database Capsule Backups:](/products/backups)** Configure retention and test restoration.
- **[Storage Capsule Backups:](/products/storage-capsule/backups)** Manage file backup settings.
