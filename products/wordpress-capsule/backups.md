# Backups

WordPress stores content in two locations: the MySQL database (posts, pages, users, settings) and file storage (themes, plugins, uploaded media). Production WordPress requires backups for both locations to ensure complete site restoration.

Code Capsules provides infrastructure-level backups through Database and Storage Capsules. Configure backups for your WordPress site:

- **Database Backups:** See the [Database Capsule backup documentation](/products/backups) to configure retention and test restoration.
- **Storage Backups:** See the [Storage Capsule backup documentation](/products/storage-capsule/backups) to manage file backup settings.
