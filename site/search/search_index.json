The term exists in many forms, such as PaaS (Platform as a Service) or FaaS (Functions as a Service) and every major cloud has some form of Serverless service, which allows us as developers to continuously integrate and deploy our latest code without worrying about infrastructure. Over the past few years we have enjoyed deploying our backend applications to Heroku and our static Frontend applications to Netlify . We found the developer experiences to be incredible and many of my projects still easily deploy from a git push , even years after initially setting it up. Major Problems we faced as Developers Our company projects at Appstrax are generally deployed and maintained at a variety of cloud providers, from AWS or Heroku to smaller local [to South Africa] shared server environments. This caused a few problems over time for a company like ours. Managing Client Infrastructure Billing We needed to manage the billing for all of our client projects' infrastructure each month. We used to collect all of the invoices from the various cloud providers and divide them up to the relevant client and ultimate re-invoice to recover the costs. This does depend on the client, for us it was mostly non-technical clients that wanted us to manage the infrastructure on their behalf. It would be great if we could just have those non-technical clients enter their payment methods against the relevant cloud resources and get invoiced directly, saving us some admin time. Knowledge Transfer When a team mate left the company, there was a long and involved process to hand over all the correct project information. We needed to make sure we had the right private keys, cloud account logins, documentation and processes to maintain and deploy to the relevant servers. A solution was needed going forward whereby the need for exchanging private keys and account logins was avoided to maintain a projects integrity. Managing SSL certificates Managing SSL certificates and private keys were a nightmare depending on the cloud or platform you were using for that project. We wanted to avoid touching any private keys or server terminals at all and just have every project automate their SSL through something like LetsEncrypt. Context Switch Team mates would often context switch between various cloud providers depending on where the project was located when needing to maintain or fix deployments and infrastructure. If we had one unified dashboard that every team mate was familiar with, our productivity as a company would be heavily improved. Lack of South African PaaS Local South African servers lack decent developer experience when it comes to anything like CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Deployment) and Heroku and Netlify only targeted US or EU servers. We thought it would be epic if we could have one platform that would combine all of our favorite PaaS features into one, while solving some of the above problems for us, especially CI/CD to local South African servers. We started prototyping Code Capsules in 2019 through the use of various cloud-native and open source technologies, which has resulted in the application that is now in an Open Beta status. Deploying a Static Frontend App After installing our Github Application into your Code Capsules user account and team, you are able to easily create a Frontend Capsule in few simple steps. Select your Github Repository and Branch Choose which folder within your Github Repository contains your static app (Angular, React or Vue) Enter the Build Command, which will tell Code Capsules which command to use to generate your static HTML and JavaScript content Enter the resulting Static Content Folder Path (the result of the build command) If you enter the Build Command, you will notice that it runs through the Build Logs on the Capsule Details screen: If you have a plain old HTML and JavaScript app, you may not need a Build Command. You can simply enter the folder path within your Github Repository that contains the index.html file, which Code Capsules will serve up once deployed. Deploying a Backend App Similar to the Frontend Capsule workflow, a few simple steps is all it takes to get your Backend App online: Select your Github Repository and Branch Choose which folder within your Github Repository contains your static app (Node, Python, Java or .NET Core) Enter the Run Command , which will tell Code Capsules which command to use to start your server (ensure your app binds to a PORT environment variable) The Backend Capsule will build your code into a container and try to serve up your application. It also automatically creates a new build and deploy every time push new code to your Github branch. This can be turned off if you prefer to create builds manually. You can view the server logs below: Both Frontend and Backend Capsules will automatically create a free subdomain with an SSL certificate installed. You can choose to point a custom domain to your capsule through either a CNAME or A Record from any DNS provider you may be using. Team Management We have broken down the solution to allow developers to manage their applications and cloud resources that best meets their needs. You can create as many Teams as you want You can create as many Spaces within Teams as you want You can invite users into your Team You can add different payment methods to different teams, which is helpful if you want to link your clients credit card directly to the Team You can view invoices broken down by Team You can manage Github Repositories per Team Check out our Documentation and Tutorials if you are keen to give it a go.

Traditionally, you need to set up a web server including the operating system and supporting software and libraries. Then you need to deploy your code, configure it, and monitor it to ensure it keeps running. Because most developers do not want to be so deeply involved in \"operations\", an alternative is to use a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering. These platforms need only minimal configuration and offer an integration with GitHub or similar so that you, as a developer, can simply push new code to your repository and have it deployed to a production environment automatically. We deployed a basic Python (Flask) web application to three PaaS providers: Heroku, DigitalOcean App Platform, and Code Capsules. In this article, we compare these for ease-of-use and show step-by-step instructions on how to get started with each. The platforms we tested are: Heroku DigitalOcean App Platform Code Capsules This guide will help you decide which platform to choose. We'll start with an overview of the metrics showing how long and how many clicks it took to deploy our simple \"Hello, world!\" application to each provider. Ease-of-use benchmarks We compared each platform on: The time it took to deploy the web application to production on each platform. How complicated each platform's user interface is. How intuitive the platform was to use overall. These measurements are necessarily somewhat subjective, but by following the steps or taking a look at them below, you should be able to form your own opinion too. Timing results To test the simplicity of each platform, we performed the platform-specific steps (as detailed later in this article) twice. Each attempt we recorded how long it took to get from GitHub to production. Attempt # Code Capsules Heroku DigitalOcean 1 7 min 30 sec 10 min 5 sec 12 min 11 sec 2 4 min 45 sec 5 min 2 sec 6 min 1 sec Code Capsules was the fastest in both runs, and also had the least difference in timing between runs, indicating that is simpler than the other two, with a smaller learning curve. Number of clicks We also counted the total number of UI clicks: that is, the number of clicks after creating an account to reach a deployed web application. Code Capsules Heroku DigitalOcean 8 clicks 9 clicks 11 clicks General impressions Heroku's interface was the most complicated, providing many pricing and other options. As the most mature platform of the three, it has acquired more features over time, but these are generally a hinderance if you just want to deploy a basic application. DigitalOcean provided a simpler platform, but requires payment details up front which slows down the initial process. Code Capsules was the simplest for a first-time user. It follows a simple pipeline of three steps to get from GitHub to production. Finally, each platform offers a custom domain name to host your application. DigitalOcean generates a fully random name which can't be changed during the deployment process (though it can be customized later in their settings page.) Heroku allows a customized domain, but as it is the most popular platform it is hard to find an available domain. The first name we chose on Code Capsules was accepted. Step-by-step guide to deploy to each provider Let's take a look at how to create the web application we tested these platforms with, and how to deploy it to the platforms tested. Prerequisites To follow along you should have general programming knowledge and be able to use GitHub. This means you can send code from a local repository to a remote repository. You should also have (instructions at each link): Python version 3.5 or above installed. A GitHub account and Git installed. Python's virtualenv installed . A working credit card to test out DigitalOcean (free of charge). General steps for building the web application The following steps need to be carried out only once for all three providers. They will show you how to install local dependencies and create the \"Hello, world!\" app. Installing virtualenv If you already have virtualenv and know what it does, skip to the next section. Using virtualenv, you can create a virtual Python environment. This virtual environment will contain only the essential modules for your web application. To install virtualenv, open up your terminal and type: pip3 install virtualenv Now that you have a current version of Python, Git, a GitHub account, and virtualenv installed, you can create the \"Hello, world!\" application. Setting up the virtual environment First, create a directory for your project. I named my directory \"helloWorld\". Open your command line, and enter the created directory. Within the directory, create the virtual Python environment by typing virtualenv env . To activate the virtual environment, type the following from within the newly created directory: Linux/MacOSX source env/bin/activate Windows env\\Scripts\\activate.bat Your terminal should now look something like this: Installing Flask and Gunicorn For our web application we'll use two popular Python tools for web development: Flask and Gunicorn : Flask is a lightweight web-development framework for Python. It provides a number of easy-to-use resources and tools for building and maintaining web applications, websites, and similar services. Gunicorn is a WSGI server for sending code to the production environment. Check out this link to read more about WSGI servers . Install these tools with the following pip command. (Ensure you are in your virtual environment before running this command.) pip3 install flask gunicorn Coding the application Now that we have set up our requirements, we can write the code for our application. Create a new Python file within the current directory and name it anything. I named mine \"helloFlask\". Next, enter the following code. from flask import Flask app = Flask ( __name__ ) # __name__ = name of program @app . route ( '/' ) # Display on main page of the domain def hello (): return 'Hello, world!' if __name__ == '__main__' : app . run () This program will display \"Hello, world!\" on the domain hosted by Code Capsules, Heroku, and DigitalOcean. Creating the Procfile A Procfile is necessary to tell our platform of choice what to do with our code. You can read more about what a Procfile does here . Create a new file within the same directory. Name it Procfile. Next, open the Procfile and enter the following code on the first line. web: gunicorn fileName:app Replace \"fileName\" with the name of your Python file. Save the Procfile. Freezing the requirements Our final step before uploading the web application to GitHub is to create a list of requirements for it. This is necessary for the platform to know what to install to run our web application. Luckily, pip makes this easy. In the same terminal, enter pip3 freeze > requirements.txt . This will create a file titled \"requirements.txt\", that contains all the project's requirements. Your directory should look similar to this: ProjectDirectory + env + helloFlask.py + requirements.txt + Procfile Uploading to GitHub Send the Procfile, requirements.txt, and Python files to a remote repository on GitHub. If you are unfamiliar with how to do this, read this article for further information. With our application on GitHub, we will be able to link the repository to each platform we test and deploy our web application. Provider-specific steps Each of the following steps is specific to one of the providers. If you only want to test one of them, skip to that section. Code Capsules Code Capsules is the newest of the three providers and they advertise ease of use as their unique selling point. Creating an account with Code Capsules and connecting to GitHub First, we need to create an account with Code Capsules. Follow these instructions to get started: Go to Code Capsules . Click SIGN UP in the top right corner and follow the instructions. Check your email and confirm your account. Go back to Code Capsules and log into your newly created account. After logging in, Code Capsules brings you to a page that will look similar to this. For now, ignore anything that you see on this picture that isn't on your account. Now that we have created a Code Capsules account, we can connect Code Capsules to our GitHub account. Perform the following: Click your profile name on the top right corner and click Edit profile . Under \"GitHub\" details, click the GitHub button. Under repository access, give Code Capsules access to our recently created repository. We are now connected to GitHub. Navigate back to the main screen. Creating a team, space, and a capsule Code Capsules organizes your code into three distinct containers: Teams Spaces Capsules These are different levels of organization to manage larger projects. For our purposes, we will only need one of each. To create a capsule, we must create a team and space. A team allows you to invite multiple people to collaborate with you. You may assign team members to different spaces, which can contain different capsules. Capsules provide cloud resources such as databases, APIs, and servers. Follow these steps to get your code into production: Create a new team and name it anything. Choose \"Create a New Space For Your Apps\". Select your region (I chose the Netherlands). Choose your name for the space. Your space is now created! Click on your newly created space. Create a new capsule. Choose the \"Backend\" Capsule. Select \"Sandbox\". Select the correct GitHub repository and click Next . Because we have a Procfile in our repository, we do not need to use a run command. Instead, click Create Capsule . Viewing your work Now that you have created a capsule, you can see your website. Click on the Overview button. Your URL is displayed under \"domain\". Enter it into your browser to see your web application! Heroku Heroku provides similar services to Code Capsules and DigitalOcean. Heroku is the original Cloud platform as service (PaaS). Heroku aims to allow developers to focus on their core product, while they take care of the rest. Creating an account with Heroku and creating an application We must first create a Heroku account. Do the following: Go to www.heroku.com. Register an account by clicking Sign up in the top right corner. Log into the registered account. Accept terms of service. Check your email and confirm your account. Now that we have created a Heroku account, we can create an application. An application is similar to a Code Capsules \"capsule\". Go to www.heroku.com and log in. Click Create new app . Choose an app name that is not in use (I chose hello-flask-tutorial). Choose your region (I chose the United States). Click Create app . Connecting to GitHub and sending to production After creating your app, Heroku presents several options to you. Under \"Deployment method\", click GitHub , and follow these steps: Click the connect to GitHub option, and perform the required tasks. Now that you are connected to GitHub, type your repositories name under \"Search for a repository to connect to\". I've named mine \"flask-hello\". Connect to this repository. After connecting, click Deploy Branch in the \"Manual Deploy\" section at the bottom of the page. Wait until it has finished deploying. When the deployment is finished, navigate to the top of the page and click Open app to see the result! DigitalOcean App Platform The DigitalOcean App Platform is another PaaS alternative. It contains the same key features as Code Capsules and Heroku. Creating an account and linking your repository DigitalOcean is the only platform here that requires a credit card. At the time of writing, DigitalOcean offers a free trial worth a $100 credit on their platform, so you will not be charged until the $100 is spent. Ensure that you have canceled your billing account so that you will not be charged in the future. Create a new account by performing these steps: Visit https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/. Click the Get Started button, and sign up via email. You will now need to enter your payment information. (I chose a credit card.) Click Deploy a GitHub Repo . Click Launch Your App . Choose \"Link your GitHub account\". Log into your GitHub account and press the Only select repositories button. Pick the repository containing your Flask application. Press the Authorize and Install button. From the drop-down menu, choose the repository containing the Flask application. Finishing up and deploying your code DigitalOcean redirects you to a new set of steps. Follow the remaining instructions carefully: Choose your region. (I chose New York.) Pick the proper branch you want to deploy from (default is \"main\"). Change the run command to gunicorn --worker-tmp-dir /dev/shm file:app This is important . Without performing this step, your application will not deploy. Change file to the name of your Python file (mine was helloFlask ). Select the \"Basic\" plan. Press Launch Basic App and your application will now be built. View the application by entering the link under the application's name in your web browser. Conclusion All three providers provide similar features but some of them are easier to use, especially for new users. They each provide auto-deploy functionality, meaning that you can largely forget about them after setup and simply push any changes to your GitHub repository. The integration with GitHub means that the provider will get a notification about the code changes and pull these changes into the production environment.","title":"PaaS Providers"},{"location":"comparisons/comparing-paas-providers-heroku-vs-digitalocean-vs-code-capsules/#comparing-paas-providers-heroku-vs-digitalocean-vs-code-capsules","text":"Deploying a web application to a production environment is complicated. Traditionally, you need to set up a web server including the operating system and supporting software and libraries. Then you need to deploy your code, configure it, and monitor it to ensure it keeps running. Because most developers do not want to be so deeply involved in \"operations\", an alternative is to use a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering. These platforms need only minimal configuration and offer an integration with GitHub or similar so that you, as a developer, can simply push new code to your repository and have it deployed to a production environment automatically. We deployed a basic Python (Flask) web application to three PaaS providers: Heroku, DigitalOcean App Platform, and Code Capsules.

In this article, we take a look at the different hosting solutions you can consider when it's time to deploy your Telegram bot. AWS AWS Telegram Bot Tutorial 1 AWS Telegram Bot Tutorial 2 AWS Lambda allows you to build serverless Telegram bots using a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) pricing model. This means you only pay for the resources you use, excluding idle time. Furthermore, AWS also has a generous free tier that includes 400,000 GB-seconds per month, which makes it a good option if you\u2019re building the bot for fun or as a light application that will only be used by a few people. AWS is a reasonable choice from a cost perspective, but it doesn't fare well from an ease-of-use point of view. Developers new to AWS may find there\u2019s a steep learning curve involved in using their services, as there are more steps to getting an application up and running on AWS compared to other popular PaaS providers. Microsoft Azure Azure Telegram Bot Tutorial 1 Azure Telegram Bot Tutorial 2 Microsoft Azure offers two ways to build and host a Telegram bot: Azure Functions or Azure Bot Service, both of which are serverless. The main benefits of a serverless architecture is that it allows you to focus on the code and not worry about deployment issues, such as which server to use. If you plan on having a bot on other social platforms, using the Azure Bot Service will be your best bet, as you can simply add a new channel to the same bot resource for a new social platform. When it comes to pricing, Azure Functions beats the Azure Bot Service, as the functions are free for the first 12 months. The Azure Bot Service uses a pay-as-you-go model, so you'll only pay for what you use. Google App Engine Google App Engine Telegram Bot Tutorial Google App Engine is best suited to hosting applications that have different parts working together to achieve one main purpose. As such, you can host a Telegram bot on App Engine, but you\u2019ll be committing to taking a longer route to getting your bot up and running. This is because the setup process assumes you\u2019re building a more complex app than a bot. Apps in App Engine can run in either a standard environment or a flexible environment. The standard environment has a free tier but the flexible environment doesn\u2019t. Both environments use a pay-as-you-go pricing model. Google Cloud Functions Google Cloud Functions Telegram Bot Tutorial Google Cloud Functions is tailor-made to run individual services that have a single purpose. This means it's a good choice for event-driven solutions such as a Telegram bot using webhooks to only invoke a function after it receives a message from a user. Cloud Functions also offers a perpetual free tier, which gives customers up to 2 million free invocations per month. If you exceed the 2 million quota, you will be charged for each million invocations thereafter. On the downside, Google Cloud Functions has a limited feature set when compared to its competitors like AWS Lambda, which might be a sticking point if you\u2019re planning on building a serverless function with extensive features. Google Cloud Run Google Cloud Run Telegram Bot Tutorial Google Cloud Run is a cloud compute platform created to host applications that have high computational needs. It is therefore perfectly capable of hosting a Telegram bot, but turns out to be a pricier option beyond the free tier when compared to its sibling, Cloud Functions (which can do the same). This is because you\u2019ll be using more demanding resources, but this shouldn\u2019t be a concern if you aren\u2019t building an enterprise bot, since it has a generous free tier. Heroku Heroku Telegram Bot Tutorial 1 Heroku Telegram Bot Tutorial 2 Heroku Telegram Bot Tutorial 3 Heroku is a PaaS provider for hosting dynamic backend applications. A Telegram bot is a backend application in one form, and so can be hosted on Heroku. Heroku is generally easy to use and is well-documented, which means you shouldn\u2019t struggle to deploy your bot. Heroku uses a more traditional architecture and doesn\u2019t offer serverless functions, so developers have to figure out how many servers \u2013 or dynos, as Heroku calls them \u2013 their application needs. The platform also has a free tier that allows you to host a Telegram bot, and is fairly priced should you exceed its limits. Code Capsules Code Capsules Telegram Bot Tutorial Code Capsules offers different types of capsules or servers to meet your hosting needs, from frontend and backend applications to databases. A Telegram bot can be hosted by a Backend Capsule with minimal hassle, as the platform is relatively easy to use and navigate. Code Capsules only has a free tier for Frontend Capsules, meaning you will have to pay to make use of its Backend Capsules. Code Capsules also supports a wide variety of languages, ensuring you have plenty of options to choose from when deciding on the tech stack for your bot. Red Hat OpenShift OpenShift Telegram Bot Tutorial 1 OpenShift Telegram Bot Tutorial 2 Red Hat OpenShift is an enterprise Kubernetes platform that\u2019s built for an open hybrid cloud strategy. Using OpenShift to host a Telegram bot might be considered overkill, since the platform was built for far more demanding enterprise use cases. There\u2019s also a learning curve involved when setting up your first OpenShift container, which you\u2019ll need to deploy your Telegram bot. OpenShift does have a free trial, but the process of buying it officially has a lot of steps and sometimes sales agents are involved depending on the plan you will be buying. PythonAnywhere PythonAnywhere Telegram Bot Tutorial PythonAnywhere is an online IDE and PaaS for hosting projects you\u2019d have written in the browser. This makes it convenient and easy to use, especially for beginners who might find any project setup stage daunting. The experience is synonymous to that of other popular serverless functions providers, as the developer only has to worry about writing their code. You can host a Telegram bot with PythonAnywhere, but you're limited to developing and hosting Python projects, which leaves out other popular languages like Node.js, Java and C#. PythonAnywhere has a basic plan that is free, but it doesn\u2019t support applications at scale. For applications that need scaling, the Hacker plan costs $5 per month and can support apps that get up to 10,000 hits a day. Oracle Cloud Oracle Cloud is a cloud compute platform offering IaaS and PaaS products. It is more than capable of hosting a Telegram bot using its functions service in the PaaS branch. However, developers new to the platform might find it hard to navigate, as their site is flooded with the many different kinds of services they offer. Beyond that, it is a reputable platform with a 30-day free trial to allow you to test drive the service you sign up for. At the end of the free trial, you\u2019ll be billed for the resources you use on a pay-as-you-go model. Vercel Vercel Telegram Bot Tutorial 1 Vercel Telegram Bot Tutorial 2 Vercel is a PaaS provider primarily used for hosting frontend and static sites, but their serverless functions offering makes it possible to deploy a Telegram bot to their platform. The serverless functions support Node.js, Go, Python and Ruby, so you have plenty of options to choose from when it comes to deciding which language to write your bot in. Vercel is also a relatively easy-to-use platform, meaning that even new developers shouldn\u2019t struggle to host their first project with them. The platform has a free plan that unfortunately doesn\u2019t support functions. The package that supports functions starts at $20 per team member per month and has a 14-day free trial period. Joyent Triton Joyent is a cloud compute platform offering an array of services from IaaS to PaaS. Users can host a Telegram bot on Joyent through their Node.js Support service, which they claim is uniquely equipped to deliver the highest level of support for powerful enterprise applications. The platform is mainly geared towards enterprise customers, so if you just want to host a Telegram bot to showcase to friends and family, this provider might be overkill. Conclusion There are many providers capable of hosting a Telegram bot, but the choice as to which one is right for you will mainly depend on the tech stack you plan to use and the size of your budget. If evaluating which provider to use from an ease-of-use perspective and how quickly you can get your bot up and running, then Code Capsules and PythonAnywhere come out on top, with the latter having the disadvantage of only being able to host Python projects. Code Capsules supports most of the popular modern languages, including but not limited to Python, Node.js and Go, but has the disadvantage that it doesn't have a free tier for Backend Capsules, which you'll need to host a Telegram bot.","title":"Telegram Hosting Providers"},{"location":"comparisons/comparing-telegram-bot-hosting-providers/#comparing-telegram-bot-hosting-providers","text":"Bots are perfect for handling repetitive tasks and have been slowly but surely increasing in popularity over the course of the last decade.

Respectively, these are: Software as a Service Platform as a Service Infrastructure as a Service But what do any of these terms actually mean? And what's the difference between them? In this article, we will provide a practical, hands-on overview of the differences, strengths and weaknesses of these three types of cloud services. We will add examples of each, and the types of things you might build with them. Let's say we're interested in building a budgeting application. This will initially be for personal use, but we might want to let other people use it in future, or even build a business out of it. We could choose to use any of these three types of services to build our application, but each one has different pros and cons. The chosen service will determine both the skills we'll need, and the limitations we'll need to work with. Roughly speaking, we will need greater depth and breadth of technical expertise as you move up the ladder from SaaS to IaaS, but we'll also have more flexibility. Below, we'll go through each one and discuss how we might use it to build our budgeting application. Software as a Service (SaaS) Pros Cons Quick to get started with. Limited flexibility. Requires little or no programming knowledge. Significant vendor lock-in. Likely to be inefficient and costly at scale. Just about any application that runs in your browser can be considered Software as a Service (SaaS). SaaS examples include Google Drive and its associated office suite \u2013 Google Docs, Google Sheets, and others \u2013 as well as other file management services like Dropbox, communication platforms like Slack, and knowledge management solutions like Notion and Confluence. If we were to build a budgeting application using SaaS, we could do it without writing a large amount of code. We could start with a simple Google Sheet, attached to a Google Form, where the user would manually enter each transaction they make during the month. The user would specify the amount, whether it's an income, expense or investment, and add a comment about what it was for: e.g. \"Monthly salary\" or \"Groceries\". We could then use macros to calculate the user's total income and expenditure for each month. We could make this more complex by using multiple forms and spreadsheets to do things like allowing the user to set up a budget at the beginning of each month. We could also integrate investments into our spreadsheets, using the GOOGLEFINANCE macro to fetch stock prices in real time. We could then expand out of spreadsheets and forms by using another SaaS platform like IFTTT or Zapier to send a monthly digest email to the user's G-mail address, or warning emails if they start coming close to their allotted budget for a particular kind of expense. And if the user is more active on Slack than on email, we could also set up Slack alerts. If we want something more than email and Slack alterts, we could use a SaaS platform such as Glide to build a custom application using our original spreadsheets as a data backend. With a bit of tweaking, we could make it possible for others to use it, too. Our full application architecture would now look like this: In this way, we can get a fully functional budgetting application with multiple integrations working by using different SaaS solutions together, and without writing any code. However, if we're interested in building a business out of this application, we may soon run into problems like expensive per-user fees and a lack of flexibility and control. Glide's visual editor may not allow us to design our application in the exact way we want to, or we may run up against the limitations of what sorts of data analysis can reasonably be done using spreadsheets. SaaS platforms also have the strongest vendor lock-in of the three types of services discussed in this article. If the SaaS we're using closes down or radically changes its software, we may be unable to extract all of your data. And even if we are able to extract our data, it's unlikely that we'll be able to import it directly into a different SaaS and keep going. For example, if our budget application uses a lot of functionality specific to Google Sheets, such as the GOOGLEFINANCE macro, and Google decides to shut down Sheets, we should be able to download our sheets as XLSX files and move them to a competing platform, such as Microsoft Office 365 . But we'll then have to do a lot of manual tinkering to get everything to work again on this new service. In some cases, we may even have to remove functionality that's not supported by the new service. And seeing as we're using multiple SaaS platforms together, as in the above architecture, we're dependent on them continuing to support each other. For example, if Slack changes its API in a way that breaks Zapier's integration with it, our budgeting application's Slack integration will be broken until Zapier updates their software. Worse still, if Slack chooses to stop supporting the kinds of integrations we want, we will have to scramble to find an alternative solution to notify users about their budgets. SaaS solutions provide a great way to quickly prototype ideas, but may prove unreliable and limiting if you need them to work over a long timescale or for a large number of users. Using Google Sheets and some integrations to build a budgeting app for yourself is not a bad idea, and you could even develop it to the point of accepting other users, but if you want to build a sustainable business with your application, you may be better off looking into a PaaS or IaaS solution instead. Platform as a Service (PaaS) Pros Cons Requires no infrastructure set-up. May be inefficient or costly at scale. The vendor is responsible for system maintenance and security patches. Less vendor lock-in than SaaS, more than IaaS. Unlike most SaaS solutions, Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions are specifically intended for use by developers. You can think of a PaaS as anywhere you can upload code and have it automatically deployed and run. PaaS solutions include Code Capsules, Heroku, Netlify, Google App Engine and AWS Elastic Beanstalk. If you've deployed a Capsule before, you'll be familiar with the process of working with a PaaS. If you haven't, it generally goes like this: Write application code in a language and framework of your choice. Push code to a source code repository on a code hosting platform such as GitHub. Link your GitHub profile to the PaaS of your choice, locate the repository you want to deploy, and click \"Deploy\". Your application will be live on a URL that looks like myapp.paas.com. Depending on the PaaS and the type of application being deployed, the developer may need to include deployment configuration instructions with their application code. For example, in many of our tutorials , it is necessary to create files named Procfile and requirements.txt prior to deployment. Users of a PaaS will need to write a lot of code. In return, they get flexibility and a reduced level of vendor lock-in compared to building on SaaS solutions. Writing your own custom code gives you far more customisation options and areas where you can make specific optimisations. Users of PaaS solutions do not require system administration knowledge, as the PaaS will be responsible for configuring their code to run correctly. Different PaaS solutions target different parts of the standard three-layer application stack made up of frontend (HTML and JavaScript that runs in users' browsers), backend (code that runs on servers) and data persistence (databases and datastores that record information such as user login details). Some PaaS solutions are highly focused on a single part of the stack, while others offer solutions for multiple areas of the stack. The table below gives some examples of each. Areas of the stack PaaS solution examples Frontend Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3, GitHub Pages, Code Capsules (Frontend capsules) Backend Heroku, OpenShift, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, Code Capsules (Backend capsules) Data persistence MongoDB Atlas, AWS RDS, Azure SQL Database Frontend code can be included with backend code, and some PaaS solutions offer data persistence solutions, so you may be able to deploy a complete application as a single project on a single PaaS, but you can also use multiple PaaS solutions for different stack components. If we were to build our budgeting application on PaaS solutions, we would start by writing the application code. We might do this in Python with a framework like Flask, in Node.js with a framework like Express, in Ruby with a framework like Sinatra, or any number of other languages, depending on PaaS support. We may also use a frontend framework such as Vue or React. We would also need to choose a data store: either a relational database like PostgreSQL or a NoSQL document store like MongoDB . Then we would need to choose one or more PaaS solutions which supports our chosen technologies. Let's say we developed our budgeting application using Code Capsules to host our back- and frontend code and MongoDB Atlas to store our data. We could combine the backend and frontend code into a single backend capsule. Alternatively, we could create a frontend capsule with our application frontend and have it interact with an API created in a backend capsule \u2013 we might do this if we wanted to reuse our backend for a mobile application. Our budgeting app would be a web application with user login. Custom functionality would need to be developed for entering transactions, setting budgets and viewing spending reports, but we would have total flexibility in how all of this worked, without being constrained by the interfaces of Google Sheets or Google Forms. For example, we could create specialised forms for common transactions with user-friendly features like autocomplete based on existing data. If we're feeling really ambitious, we could integrate open banking into our application and have transactions fetched automatically rather than having to enter them manually. Using a single backend capsule, our application architecture would look something like this: Using a backend and frontend capsule, our application architecture would look like this: In the above architecture, we could replace the frontend module with a Netlify site, and the backend module with a collection of AWS Lambda functions, or just about any other PaaS solution that provides the appropriate area of the stack. Using PaaS solutions is the middleground between using SaaS and IaaS solutions in terms of ease of setup versus flexibility and control. Using a PaaS will lead to some level of vendor lock-in, especially if you use something like AWS Lambda. However, in most cases, we will be able to move our code to a different PaaS if the one we're using shuts down or stops supporting something we rely on. We may have to do some reconfiguration, but this is likely to be less onerous than moving between SaaS solutions. As we are not doing our own system administration when we use a PaaS solution, we won't be able to optimise our infrastructure for the needs of our application. If we're not careful about how we design our application, it may end up being much more expensive to run than it would be on an IaaS solution. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Pros Cons Highly flexible. Requires programming and system administration knowledge. Can be configured more precisely and efficiently than SaaS and PaaS solutions. Requires regular maintenance. Very little vendor lock-in ... Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solutions are the most technically demanding of their users. Rather than providing end-user software or deployment for user-developed code, most IaaS solutions merely provide you with virtual machines (VMs), commonly called a \"compute instance\". These are fully capable computers that you have full control over and responsibility for. Examples of IaaS services include AWS Elastic Computing (EC) 2, Google Cloud Platform's Compute Engine, and Digital Ocean's Droplets. To deploy an app using an IaaS solution, we follow these general steps: Create a virtual machine, specifying how much CPU power, RAM and hard drive storage space you want, as well as its operating system. Specify firewall rules for this virtual machine \u2013 for most simple web applications, you'll need to specify that TCP ports 80 and 443 should be open, as well as port 22, for your remote access. Access your virtual machine over a secure shell (SSH), generally using an SSH key like you would with GitHub. Install a web server, database management system, and all the other requirements for your application. Upload your application's code to your server. Ensure that all of your supporting software is configured correctly and your application's code files can be located and read by your webserver, and then start your application. Buy a domain name and configure it to point to the IP address of your virtual server. This is quite a lot more effort than using a PaaS, and it requires some specialised knowledge in addition to programming. In our budgeting app example, we would be able to take the same code you might deploy to a PaaS and use that on an IaaS: for example, we could take code we've uploaded to Code Capsules and upload it to an AWS EC2 instance instead. We would just need to install and set up your own webserver (usually Apache or nginx), and our own database (either a traditional relational database like PostgreSQL or a NoSQL document store like MongoDB). We could also put the database on a second EC2 instance, and configure your networking rules to allow both instances to speak to each other over the relevant port. Our application architecture would look now look like the diagram below. Note that we would retain our open banking integration, as that is defined in code. The benefit this gives you is total control over your infrastructure, which can have efficiency and cost savings over working with a PaaS. How much will depend on your level of expertise and the amount of time you can allocate to optimising and managing your infrastructure. Depending on our application's architecture, we might create more than one VM for serving the application and managing the database, using load balancers and data replication. Alternatively, we may just dynamically increase the CPU speed, RAM and disk space of one or two VMs. The other major benefit to using IaaS over SaaS or PaaS is that it has essentially no vendor lock-in. Just about everything you do on an AWS EC2 instance will work just as well on a virtual machine provided by Google Compute Engine or Digital Ocean, or even a physical server in a pre-cloud datacentre. But with great power comes great responsibility. Anything we build on an IaaS solution will require regular maintenance \u2013 we will be responsible for keeping our virtual machines' software up-to-date. This is extremely important for internet-facing infrastructure, as out-of-date software can contain security vulnerabilities which could lead to our application being hacked, even if all of our own code is completely secure. Conclusion The choice between SaaS, PaaS and IaaS solutions will depend on your and your team's depth and breadth of expertise, how you aim to manage your time, and what stage of development you're in. The same application could go from a proof-of-concept build on SaaS solutions to a custom built application running on PaaS solutions, and then move over to the IaaS to improve performance or costs. Or you could use a mix of all three: the choice between SaaS, PaaS and IaaS does not have to all-or-nothing. Instead, it's worth making an independent decision for each area of your application stack. For example, you can have an application that runs on an AWS EC2 instance (IaaS), stores data in an AWS RDS database (PaaS) and sends users notifications on Slack (SaaS). Or you could create a Netlify website (PaaS) that communicates with a an API deployed on Code Capsules (PaaS), which in turn uses a PostgreSQL database running on an AWS EC2 instance (IaaS). The possibilities are endless.","title":"SaaS vs PaaS vs IaaS"},{"location":"comparisons/saas-paas-iaas/#saas-vs-paas-vs-iaas","text":"If you've spent any amount of time trying out or researching cloud services, you've probably come across acronyms like SaaS, PaaS and IaaS.

We would just need to install and set up your own webserver (usually Apache or nginx), and our own database (either a traditional relational database like PostgreSQL or a NoSQL document store like MongoDB). We could also put the database on a second EC2 instance, and configure your networking rules to allow both instances to speak to each other over the relevant port. Our application architecture would look now look like the diagram below. Note that we would retain our open banking integration, as that is defined in code. The benefit this gives you is total control over your infrastructure, which can have efficiency and cost savings over working with a PaaS. How much will depend on your level of expertise and the amount of time you can allocate to optimising and managing your infrastructure. Depending on our application's architecture, we might create more than one VM for serving the application and managing the database, using load balancers and data replication. Alternatively, we may just dynamically increase the CPU speed, RAM and disk space of one or two VMs. The other major benefit to using IaaS over SaaS or PaaS is that it has essentially no vendor lock-in. Just about everything you do on an AWS EC2 instance will work just as well on a virtual machine provided by Google Compute Engine or Digital Ocean, or even a physical server in a pre-cloud datacentre. But with great power comes great responsibility. Anything we build on an IaaS solution will require regular maintenance \u2013 we will be responsible for keeping our virtual machines' software up-to-date. This is extremely important for internet-facing infrastructure, as out-of-date software can contain security vulnerabilities which could lead to our application being hacked, even if all of our own code is completely secure.","title":"Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)"},{"location":"comparisons/saas-paas-iaas/#conclusion","text":"The choice between SaaS, PaaS and IaaS solutions will depend on your and your team's depth and breadth of expertise, how you aim to manage your time, and what stage of development you're in. The same application could go from a proof-of-concept build on SaaS solutions to a custom built application running on PaaS solutions, and then move over to the IaaS to improve performance or costs. Or you could use a mix of all three: the choice between SaaS, PaaS and IaaS does not have to all-or-nothing. Instead, it's worth making an independent decision for each area of your application stack. For example, you can have an application that runs on an AWS EC2 instance (IaaS), stores data in an AWS RDS database (PaaS) and sends users notifications on Slack (SaaS). Or you could create a Netlify website (PaaS) that communicates with a an API deployed on Code Capsules (PaaS), which in turn uses a PostgreSQL database running on an AWS EC2 instance (IaaS). The possibilities are endless.","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"deployment/","text":"Deployment guides Code Capsules supports most front and backend frameworks and libraries.

Open index.js and edit the code snippet below by replacing <YOUR-CAPSULE-URL-HERE> with the actual value for your Capsule's URL. To get this value, navigate to your Capsule's \u201cOverview\u201d tab. Copy the value under the \u201cDomains\u201d section and paste it in place of <YOUR-CAPSULE-URL-HERE> in the code snippet below. bot . launch ({ webhook : { domain : '<YOUR-CAPSULE-URL-HERE>' , port : process . env . PORT } }) Push your changes to GitHub by running git push in a terminal window while in the project's root folder. Code Capsules will automatically rebuild your bot after it notices changes to the main branch of your forked repository. Chat with the Bot The bot will be able to respond to messages after Code Capsules finishes building it. When this is done, search for your bot on Telegram using the username you assigned it and start a chat with it. The bot has been programmed to respond to /start and echo any messages you send it.

Add Environment Variables Our bot's logic makes use of environment variables to function securely. You'll need to add the variables to your capsule's \"Configure\" tab before the bot can send/receive messages from your workspace. For the first environment variable, SLACK_BOT_TOKEN : Head over to your app dashboard on Slack, and click on the \"OAuth & Permissions\" menu item on the left-hand side. Click the \"Install to Workspace\" button followed by the \"Allow\" button. Actioning the preceeding 2 steps should reveal a newly generated \"Bot User OAuth Token\". Copy this token. On your capsule's \"Configure\" tab, add a new environment variable with the name SLACK_BOT_TOKEN and set its value to the token you copied in the previous step. Click the \"Update Capsule\" button to save your changes. For the second environment variable, SLACK_CHANNEL_ID : Open Slack and right-click on the channel name of the channel you want to send messages to. On the context menu that appears, choose \"Copy Link\". Paste the link in a browser tab but don't press \"enter\" or \"return\". The link should follow the format, https://<workspace-name>.slack.com/archives/C01SZ6Z3TCY . The last part of that URL is the channel ID; in this example case, C01SZ6Z3TCY . Add the channel ID to the environment variables with the name SLACK_CHANNEL_ID . Click the \"Update Capsule\" button to save your changes. For the third environment variable, SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET : Head over to your Slack app dashboard and click on \"Basic Information\" on the left-hand side.

On Code Capsules, Procfiles aren't a strict requirement but can be provided if you want to. The alternative to using a Procfile is using the Code Capsules UI to specify which commands to run during the build phase of your application. Below is a screenshot showing a command that may be entered as input in the UI for a Node.js application. Procfile Naming and Location A Procfile is a simple text file. It should be named Procfile exactly and should not have any extensions, like .txt or .py . Note that naming the file procfile will not work either, as it is case sensitive. Locate your Procfile in the root folder of your project. It won't work in any other location. Procfile Processes The Procfile outlines the type of processes a Backend Capsule needs to run before deploying a backend application. Common processes include but are not limited to web , worker , and clock processes. When declaring a process type, you should also write the command to run for that particular process. A process type command allows you to specify the port you'd like the process to run, as well as other options that are process specific. Procfile Format The Procfile's format is a key value listing of process types and their commands on each line as shown below: <process type>: <command> Example Procfile for Python's Flask Code Capsules only requires a Procfile for Python applications. Here is an example of what a Procfile for a Flask application might look: web: python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=$PORT Procfiles for Other Languages Express and Java applications don't need a Procfile to be deployed.

In this reference guide, we'll take a look at the different options you have for managing your Capsule while it's deployed. Turning off a Capsule You can turn off your Capsule by toggling the radio button at the top right of the Capsule's page. The most common reason for turning a Capsule off is if you've changed or added an environment variable, in which case you'll need to toggle the Capsule back on after a few seconds for the new variable to be accessible. Depending on the purpose of your application, you might also want to turn your Capsule off during periods of inactivity to save on the cost of running your application on Code Capsules. Scale a Capsule It is possible to allocate more resources to your Capsule depending on how much traffic your application will be getting and its computational needs. To view the different scaling options available for your Capsule, navigate to the \"Scale\" tab while on your Capsule's page. Choose the package with the Capsule resources that best suit your needs by clicking on the item. Monitor Capsule Metrics Each Capsule tracks its usage data and you can view this information by opening the \"Metrics\" tab on your Capsule's page. Delete a Capsule When you no longer wish to host your application on Code Capsules, delete your Capsule by navigating to the \"Configure\" tab of the Capsule page and scrolling to the bottom. Click on the delete icon under the \"Delete Capsule\" section on the bottom right. A dialog will slide in from the right asking you whether you're sure about deleting the Capsule since this action isn't reversible.

If you have purchased a domain like example.com from a domain registrar and would like to replace it with the default Code Capsules domain, Code Capsules lets you use your own domain instead (for free). You can find everything relating to your Capsule's domains (including your default domain) under the \"Overview\" tab in the Capsule. This is also where you can add a purchased custom domain to your application. How to Add a Custom Domain To add a custom domain to your application on Code Capsules, click on the \"Overview\" tab in the Capsule hosting your application. Under Domains, you'll see all of the domains associated with your Capsule; including the default domain provided by Code Capsules. There is also an \"Add a Custom Domain\" button at the bottom of the page. Before adding a custom domain , consider: - Your capsule may route to only one root domain. You may not add multiple root domains to your Capsule. To add a custom domain: Click the \"Add a Custom Domain\" button. Save the IP address provided under \"A Record Route\" (this will be used shortly). Enter the custom domain you've purchased from a domain registrar under \"Domain Name\". Make sure that you've entered a root domain only - do not include a subdomain. A root domain contains only your domain name and your top-level domain (TLD). Take example.com . Here, \"example\" is the domain name, and \".com\" is the TLD. Once you've entered your root domain, add it by clicking the Create Domain button. Creating an A record After adding your custom domain on Code Capsules, you need to create an A record for the domain you've purchased. You'll use the IP that was saved previously when creating the A record for your domain. You can add an A record to your purchased domain by visiting your domain registrar's website. Your A record table should look something like this: Record Type Name IPv4 Address A Record @ provided-IP-Address where, \"@\" refers to your root domain. provided-IP-Address is the IP address found previously under \"A Record Route\" Consult your domain registrar for specific instructions on adding A records to your domain. Keep in mind, when making changes to your domain's DNS records , changes may take several hours to take effect. How to Add a Subdomain Before adding a subdomain to your application hosted on Code Capsules, make sure you have already created an A record for your purchased domain that routes to an application on Code Capsules. When adding a subdomain to your application hosted on Code Capsules, keep in mind: Applications hosted on Code Capsules can have a maximum of five subdomains. Wildcard subdomains are not allowed on Code Capsules - you'll need to create a CNAME record in your purchased domain for each subdomain you want to create. To add a subdomain for your application, follow the same process detailed previously , with some changes: This time you must include the subdomain you want to create. This means that instead of entering the root domain domain-name.tld , you should specify your subdomain as well, such as: app.example.com . You do not need to save the IP address provided under \"A Record Route\" when adding subdomains on Code Capsules. After clicking the Create Domain button, you must create a CNAME record for your purchased domain with information about the subdomain you'd like to create. Creating CNAME Records Creating CNAME records for purchased domains vary for different domain registrars. Consult your domain registrar for information on creating CNAME records. In general, the CNAME record table for your domain should look something like this: Record Type Name Host/Target CNAME subdomain your-root-domain where, subdomain is the subdomain you would like to create (e.g. app , www ) your-root-domain is your root domain that contains an A record routing to your application on Code Capsules. As with adding an A record, CNAME records or any other changes to your domain's DNS records may take several hours to take effect. Removing Domains and Subdomains If you would like to remove any domains or subdomains associated with your Capsule, navigate to the \"Overview\" tab in your Capsule. Under Domains, you will see a list of all the domains that are associated with your Capsule. Next to each custom domain and subdomain, you'll find a trash can icon. Click the trash can icon to remove the custom domain or subdomain. Note, removing a custom domain or subdomain does not affect your domain's DNS records: When removing a root domain on Code Capsules, your A record will still be associated with the IP address provided by Code Capsules. Make sure to revert your domain's A record to its default value. When removing a subdomain on Code Capsules, make sure to delete the corresponding CNAME record in your purchased domain. Glossary of Terms & Concepts Here is a list of defined terms and concepts used throughout this article. Divided into three sections, here you'll find definitions for: structures related to URLs, DNS records, and information related to HTTP. Makeup of a URL Uniform Resource Locator (URL) : In the above image, www.example.com is the URL. A URL is a combination of three different aspects of a domain: A subdomain, a second-level domain, and a top-level domain. Subdomain : Subdomains are the first part of a URL, the most common being www . Subdomains provide users with a consistent naming strategy to access service you may provide (for example, hr.myapplication.com may route users to your business' human resources portal). Second-level domain (SLD): Second level domains make up the middle of a URL. This is your domain's name. Top-level domain (TLD): Top-level domains are the text at the right-hand side of a URL. TLDs give users an idea about your website. For example, the .de TLD lets users know the website probably caters to a German audience. Root Domain : The root domain is a combination of a second-level and top-level domain without a subdomain. example.com is an example of a root domain, whereas www.example.com is not a root domain. DNS records Domain Registrar : A company that sells and manages domains. A Record : An A record routes a domain (e.g. example.com to an IP addresses (e.g. 123.456.567.8 ) Wildcard subdomain : A wildcard subdomain points all subdomains not created for your purchased domain to a specific place. For example, if a wildcard subdomain was created for example.com , and the subdomains info and 123 were not created for example.com , both info.example.com and 123.example.com would route to example.com . CNAME Record : A CNAME record, also known as an alias , routes subdomains to other domain names. For example, mail.example.com may route to mail.google.com . CNAME records are unlike A records, which route to a specific IP address. HTTP and SSL Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): HTTP is a protocol for transferring data from a server (a web-application) to a client (your web-browser). Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS): HTTPS is like HTTP, except the data transferred from the server to client is encrypted for better security. Secure Sockets Layer Certificate (SSL): An SSL Certificate authenticates a domain and allows encrypted information to send to the domains server - with an SSL certificate you can connect to your domain via HTTPS, i.e: https://www.example.com.","title":"Custom Domains"},{"location":"reference/custom_domains/#custom-domains","text":"For every application deployed to Code Capsules, Code Capsules provides a default domain that looks something like this: capsulename.xxxx.codecapsules.co.za .

In the \"New Data Capsule\" dialog, choose \"A persistent storage mounted directly to your capsule.\" as your data type, then click the \"Create Capsule\" button. Binding a Data Capsule to a Backend Capsule You need to bind the Data Capsule to a Backend Capsule hosted on Code Capsules before you can connect to it and use it. Navigate to the Backend Capsule and click \"Configure\" to open the capsule's config tab. Scroll down to the \"Bind Data capsule\" section where your recently created data capsule will show. Click \"Bind\" to bind your Data and Backend Capsules. During the bind process, Code Capsules creates a PERSISTENT_STORAGE_DIR environment variable to let your Backend Capsule know where your Data Capsule resides in order to access its features. Once the two capsules have been bound, you can scroll to the top of the Configure tab to find the value of this variable. The next step is to use this environment variable in code in order to read and write to our Data Capsule.

Select this option if you plan on connecting your data capsule to an application that's not hosted on Code Capsules. Binding a Data Capsule to a Backend Capsule To connect a data capsule to a backend capsule hosted on Code Capsules you need to bind the two together before you can connect to and use your data capsule. If you're not hosting your backend application on Code Capsules you can jump to this section as the binding step is not applicable in that use case. Navigate to the backend capsule and click \"Config\" to open the capsule's config tab. Scroll down to the \"Bind Data capsule\" section where your recently created data capsule will show.

Copy the value of the DATABASE_URL variable and append /your_db_name?authSource=admin to it as a query parameter. Make sure to replace your_db_name with the actual name of your database. This tells the data capsule to read and write to the specified database. If a database named your_db_name doesn't exist, the data capsule will create it.

It's the basis of services like Dropbox and Google Drive. Code Capsules's File System Data Capsule mounts as a standard file system to a Backend Capsule, providing a convenient file storage option you can use instead of a blob store on other platforms. The file systems are well supported in most programming languages and familiar to programmers. In this tutorial, we'll build a basic web interface to upload, download and delete files, secured with a simple, single-user authentication scheme. We'll use a Backend Capsule with a file store Data Capsule, Node.js as the programming language, and Express as the web framework. Overview and Requirements You'll need the following services and software set up for this tutorial Git set up and installed, and a registered GitHub account . Node.js installed. A registered Code Capsules account. An IDE or text editor to code the project in. We used Visual Studio Code in this tutorial, but you can use any tool you like. Setting Up The Project With our requirements in place, let's get started setting them for our web file store project. Creating a New Repo First, we need a place to store our code, from which Code Capsules can deploy it to a capsule. Head over to GitHub and create a new repo. We're calling it filedrop here, but you can call it whatever you like. You can choose a Node .gitignore file to get started. Clone the new GitHub repo onto your computer and navigate to that directory in terminal (or command prompt, if you're on Windows). Initializing the Base Project We'll use the Express.js application generator to create the project base. Type in the following: npx express-generator --hbs npm install Here we've created a few files and folders that we can edit. The --hbs option tells the generator to use Handlebars as the HTML template language. We're using Handlebars as it's close to plain HTML, making it easier to pick up quickly. The command npm install downloads and installs all the dependencies and packages required by the base project. Open the folder with Visual Studio Code or your chosen editor, and browse through the files to get familiar with them. The app.js file in the project root is the main entry point for the app. It's time to push this boilerplate project up to Git. Type the following into command prompt or terminal: git add . git commit -am 'added base files for project' git push origin Creating a New Backend Capsule Now we need a place to host our app. Log in to Code Capsules , and create a Team and Space for this project. Link Code Capsules to the GitHub repository created above. You can do this by clicking your username at the top right, and choosing Edit Profile . Now you can click the Github button to link to a repo. Create a new Capsule, selecting the \"Backend\" capsule type. Select the GitHub repository we created and linked to. If you're only using the repo for this project, you can leave the Repo Subpath field empty. You may need to add your repo to the team repo if you haven't already. Click the Modify Team Repos to do so. Click Next , then on the following page, click Create Capsule . Creating a New Data Capsule We'll need some data storage to store the files uploaded to the web drive. Create a new Capsule, selecting the \"Data Capsule\" type. Select \"A persistent storage mounted directly to your capsule\" as the Data Type. Choose a product size, and give the capsule a name. Click \"Create Capsule\". Linking the Capsules To use the Data Capsule with the Backend Capsule, we need to link the two. Head over to the backend capsule you created earlier, and click on the \"Configure\" tab. Scroll down to \"Bind Data Capsule\", and click \"Bind\" under the name of the data capsule you created. After binding the capsules, scroll up to the section \"Capsule Parameters\". You'll notice that an environment variable, PERSISTENT_STORAGE_DIR , is automatically added with the mount point. We'll use this environment variable in the code to access the storage drive. Writing the Web Files Code Now that we have all our systems setup, we can get onto the best part - coding! Getting the File List Open the file index.js in the routes folder of our project. This is the server code file for the default route / in the application. We'll use this route to show the file listing. To interact with the storage capsule and the files on it, we'll use the built-in fs , or file system, module included in Node.js. Add a reference to this module at the top of the file: const fs = require ( 'fs' ); Then, modify the default get route to use the fs module to get the file listing on the storage drive: router . get ( '/' , function ( req , res , next ) { fs . readdir ( process . env . PERSISTENT_STORAGE_DIR , function ( err , files ){ if ( err ) return res . sendStatus ( 500 ); files . sort (); return res . render ( 'index' , { title : \"File Drop\" , files : files }); }); }); This code uses the readdir function to get an array of all the files in the storage drive. Note that we use the environment variable that was automatically setup when we bound the capsules to specify the path to the storage drive. Environment variables are accessible through the process.env object in Node.js. The readdir function calls a callback function once it has the file list. The callback has 2 arguments: err , which will contain an error object if the folder could not be read, and files , which is a string array of all the filenames in the folder, if the call was successful. If the err object is populated, we immediately return with an HTTP code 500 using the sendStatus function. The code 500 means that the server encountered an error processing a request, so the browser can show an error page. Since the readdir function doesn't return the files in any order, we use the built-in array sort function to sort the files. By default, the sort function sorts the files in ascending alphabetical order. If you'd like a different sort order, you can supply a function to customise the behaviour here. The sorted files can now be returned to the browser. We call the res.render function, which specifies the Handlebars template to use as the return web page. The templates are stored in the views folder of the project. The function also accepts a data object as an argument. Handlebars then combines this data with the template to fill in the values on the page. Rendering the File List Our backend route gets the file list, and passes it through to the index HTML template. Let's customise that template to display the files. Open index.hbs in the views folder, and update the contents to this code: < h1 > {{title}} </ h1 > < div > < h2 > File list </ h2 > < table > < tr > < th > File Name </ th > </ tr > {{#each files}} < tr > < td > {{this}} </ td > </ tr > {{/each}} </ table > </ div > Handlebars uses the sequence {{ }} to indicate sections of the template to be populated. In the first line, {{title}} will be replaced with the title we specified in the return from the GET / route we added earlier. Then we set up a simple table, and use the Handlebars each function to iterate over the elements in the files array we passed from the Get / route. The Handlebars keyword {{this}} is used to reference the current file name on each iteration. You can save, commit and push your changes so far. Our code should deploy automatically on Code Capsules . After deploying, you can visit the public URL, and you should see something like this: This is good, but a little uninteresting without any files to view! Adding the File Upload Route Let's add functionality to upload a file, then we'll be able to view it in the list. We'll first add an HTML upload form to the index.hbs file in the views folder. Add this code under the <h1>{{title}}</h1> line: < div > < h2 > Upload a file </ h2 > < form ref = 'uploadForm' id = 'uploadForm' action = '/' method = 'post' encType = \"multipart/form-data\" > < input type = \"file\" name = \"newFile\" /> < input type = 'submit' value = 'Upload' /> </ form > </ div > This code adds in a new HTML form, which makes a POST request to the root / (our index page) on submit. We've given the form 2 inputs: a file upload field specified by the type=\"file\" attribute, and the submit button. Note the name given to the file input - we'll need to remember this when processing the upload on the server side. Now that we have a way for the user to select a file to upload and send to the server, we need to create a route to process the submitted file. In the index.js file in the routes folder, we'll add a new HTTP route. This one will be a POST route, as we are using it to upload a new file (or resource) onto the server. Add this stub for the route in the index.js file: router . post ( '/' , function ( req , res ){ }); To handle file uploads with Express, we'll use a package that takes care of all the encoding and streaming concerns of file uploads. Open up the terminal and install the express-fileupload package using npm: npm install express-fileupload To use this package, we need to add it into the middleware of our Express server. Open up the app.js file in the root folder of the project, and import the package by adding the following require statement at the top of the file: const fileUpload = require ( 'express-fileupload' ); Now insert the package into the Express middleware pipeline by adding the following line just under the var app = express(); statement: app . use ( fileUpload ()); The express-fileupload module adds a files attribute to our req object. Through the files attribute we can access any uploads as their own objects, which are named the same as the HTML form inputs . Now we can expand on the route stub. In the index.js file, complete the POST route as follows: router . post ( '/' , function ( req , res ){ if ( ! req . files || Object . keys ( req . files ). length === 0 ) { return res . status ( 400 ). send ( 'No files were uploaded.' ); } const newFile = req . files . newFile ; const uploadPath = process . env . PERSISTENT_STORAGE_DIR + '/' + newFile . name ; newFile . mv ( uploadPath , function ( err ) { if ( err ) return res . status ( 500 ). send ( err ); return res . redirect ( '/' ); }); }); First, we check whether the files object exists on the route, and if it does exist, we check whether it has sub-objects on the list (no sub-objects means no form input fields were populated). If no files objects or sub-objects exist on the route, there is no file for the code to process, so we return early with an HTTP status 400 code and a message to the user. Status code 400 means there is an input error from the user side. Otherwise, having established that a file has been uploaded, we get the file object by referencing the same name we gave to our HTML input field ( newFile ) on the files object that the express-fileupload package added to the req object. Now that we have the file object, we can construct a path to the data capsule's location to save the file. We use the environment variable for the data capsule mount point (located in the Backend Capsule's \"Capsule Parameters\"), along with the path separator / and the name of the uploaded file. You can see all the properties available on the file object at the express-fileupload npm page . All we need to do now is to save the file to the upload path. The express-fileupload package provides the method mv on the file object to save the file to a disk location. It then calls a provided callback function when done, or if an error occurs. If we get a error back, we send an HTTP code 500 back to the client, which means that there was an error on the server side. Otherwise, if all goes well, we redirect the client to the index / page, which will call the GET route added earlier to refresh the file list on the client side. This is a good point to commit the code to Git, and test the new deployment on Code Capsules. After the capsule finishes rebuilding, navigate to the site. It should look something like this: The upload control may look slightly different depending on the web browser and operating system you use. Try choosing a file and uploading it, and you should see it appear in the browser. Downloading a File We've got the functionality to upload files, and to list what files are on the server. Now let's add functionality to download files. We'll add a route with the format /filename to get the requested file. We'll make use of the download functionality built into Express to send the file back to the browser. Add this route to the index.js file. router . get ( '/:filename' , function ( req , res , next ){ const filepath = process . env . PERSISTENT_STORAGE_DIR + '/' + req . params . filename ; return res . download ( filepath ); }); This sets up a GET route, with the requested filename as a parameter. Then the function constructs a path to the file, using the environment variable for the data capsule mount point, along with the path separator / and the name of the requested file. Then we call the download method on the res (result) object with the constructed path. This sends the file to the browser. Now we need a way to call this route from the front end. Open the index.hbs file in the views folder, and modify the {{this}} template in the file list table to an HTML anchor <a> tag , with the href to the route we added above. We'll also add the download attribute to the tag so that the link will not be opened in the browser, but downloaded instead. The updated file list table should look like this now: < div > < h2 > File list </ h2 > < table > < tr > < th > File Name </ th > </ tr > {{#each files}} < tr > < td > < a href = '/{{this}}' download > {{this}} </ a > </ td > </ tr > {{/each}} </ table > </ div > Commit these changes, and wait for Code Capsules to redeploy the site. If you navigate to the site now, you should see the file you uploaded earlier as a hyperlink. Clicking on the link should download the file. Deleting a File Now that we can upload and download files, we'll probably also need to remove files. We can use the HTTP DELETE verb on a route for this. Since the data capsule appears just like a regular file system to our code, we can use the built-in Node.js fs module here again. It has a method called unlink which deletes a file from a file system. We supply it with a path to the file, and a callback function to let us know the result of the delete file request. If we get an error, we'll send an HTTP code 500 status back to the browser, to let the browser know that an error occurred. If the delete action is successful, we'll send a status code 200 , which lets the browser know that the operation was a success. Add this code to the index.js file to implement the DELETE route: router . delete ( '/:filename' , function ( req , res ){ const filepath = process . env . PERSISTENT_STORAGE_DIR + '/' + req . params . filename ; fs . unlink ( filepath , function ( err ) { if ( err ) return res . sendStatus ( 500 ); else return res . sendStatus ( 200 ); }); }); Now let's update the front end to be able to call this route. Open the index.hbs file, and add a new header column to the file table, along with a button for each file in the new column to delete it: < div > < h2 > File list </ h2 > < table > < tr > < th > File Name </ th > < th ></ th > </ tr > {{#each files}} < tr > < td > < a href = '/{{this}}' target = \"_blank\" > {{this}} </ a > </ td > < td > < button > Delete </ button > </ td > </ tr > {{/each}} </ table > </ div > Next we'll create some front-end JavaScript code for the button to call when clicked. We'll use the browser-side fetch function to call the DELETE file route. Add this script block at the bottom of the index.hbs file: < script type = \"text/javascript\" > function deleteFile ( filename ){ var confirmation = confirm ( 'Do you really want to delete the file ' + filename + '?' ); if ( confirmation === true ){ fetch ( '/' + filename , { method : 'DELETE' }) . then ( response => location . reload ()) . catch ( error => alert ( 'Error deleting the file! ' + error )); } } < /script> This adds a new function deleteFile to the front-end index page. It has one argument: the name of the file to delete. First, we make use of the built-in confirm function which exists in all browsers. This brings up a dialog box with the message Do you really want to delete the file? , just to make sure the user didn't click the delete button accidentally. If the user clicks \"Yes\", the dialog box returns a true value. Then we call our DELETE route using fetch . We need to pass in the route to call, and we also send an init object which specifies that the DELETE HTTP verb must be used to call this route. The fetch function returns a promise . This is an alternative to callbacks. If the call was successful, the code in the .then() handler is called. This reloads the page, so that the file listing is updated to show that the file is now deleted. If the call fails, the code in the catch handler is called. This uses another standard browser dialog, an alert , to let the user know that something went wrong. Now let's hook this function up to the button we added for each file. We'll use the onclick event on the buttons to call the function, along with the filename to be deleted. Update the button code like this: < button onclick = \"deleteFile('{{this}}')\" > Delete </ button > Commit these changes, and wait for Code Capsules to redeploy the site. Then navigate to the site and try out the \"Delete\" button next to the filename. Adding Authentication We've created the basic functions of a web drive, but anyone can get to the site and upload, download or delete documents. We need a way to control access. For this tutorial, we'll implement a very simple access control system that only allows access to one pre-defined user. We're going to use Passport to handle our access control. Passport is a modular package that allows for very simple authentication schemes to very elaborate ones, so you can upgrade the security of this app as you need. Our basic access control scheme is a username and password combination, entered on an HTML form that is posted to a login route. A session cookie will remember the logged-in user while they use the site, and we'll use the package express-session to manage the session. Passport's local strategy plugin will enable our username and password scheme. Let's start by installing all these packages and plugins. Type the following in the terminal: npm install passport passport-local express-session Now add references to these packages to the top section of the app.js file. A good place to add them is after the var logger = require('morgan'); line. Here's the code you'll need: var passport = require ( 'passport' ); var LocalStrategy = require ( 'passport-local' ). Strategy ; var session = require ( \"express-session\" ); The first thing to add to the app is the session middleware, then the Passport authentication middleware. Add the following after the app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'))); line: app . use ( session ({ secret : \"<YOUR_SECRET>\" })); app . use ( passport . initialize ()); app . use ( passport . session ()); This inserts the session middleware into the app pipeline, to read and write persistent sessions to the app cookie. Replace the <YOUR_SECRET> parameter with a string of your choosing. This secret is used to sign the session information in the cookie. Normally, this is kept very secret, as anyone who has access to the secret could construct a session cookie that looks legitimate to the server and give them access to any account on the server. You can also add an environment variable to store this secret, rather than store it in the code repo. Next, we initialize Passport into the middleware pipeline, and add in the code for Passport to use sessions to check and record authentication. When using sessions with Passport, we need to implement serialisation and deserialisation of user objects from session information, so that Passport can add the user object to the req object in the app pipeline. Add these functions to the bottom of the app.js file: passport . serializeUser ( function ( user , done ) { process . nextTick ( function (){ done ( null , user ); }); }); passport . deserializeUser ( function ( user , done ) { process . nextTick ( function (){ done ( null , user ); }); }); In our case, since we are implementing a super-simple authentication scheme with just one user, we don't need to call out to a database or other store to get user information. In fact, since there is no real user information that is of use to our app at the moment, we just return the user object that Passport sends to us straight back, as we don't really have a use for it. Even though we are doing nothing with the information, we need to register these functions with Passport, as it calls them regardless. Now we can set up the rest of the logic for Passport. Add this code just above the serialisation code: passport . use ( new LocalStrategy ( function ( username , password , done ) { if ( username === process . env . USERNAME && password === process . env . PASSWORD ){ return done ( null , { username : process . env . USERNAME }); } else { return done ( null , false , { message : \"Incorrect username or password\" }); } }) ); This plugs in and registers the local authentication strategy module into Passport. Passport's local strategy uses a simple username and password, checked on the local server, so we'll need a function to accept a username and password for validation. The function checks if entered credentials are valid, and sends back a user object if they are, using the done callback. If the credentials don't checkout, the user gets an error message. Our function checks the username and password against what is stored in our environment variables. If the credentials to be checked match the credentials in our environment variables, we authenticate the user. Head over to the \"Configure\" tab on your backend Code Capsule, and add 2 new environment variables : USERNAME and PASSWORD . Supply values of your own to set your username and password, then click the \"Update Capsule\" button to save the changes. Note: While this method of storing user credentials is appropriate for a small, single-user hobby project, it is not sufficient for production with customer credentials. Look to implementing a more robust user store, with password hashing and salting, or using a third-party authentication service such as a social network or an OAuth provider Passport offers many other authentication strategies , from OAuth 2.0 strategies allowing authentication through Facebook, Google, Twitter and other OAuth 2.0 providers, to API authentication strategies such as Bearer Tokens. Now that we have set the username and password for our app, we can add the login page routes to render the login page and send the form POST with user credentials to Passport. Add these 2 routes just above the index routes ( app.use('/', indexRouter); ) in app.js : app . get ( '/login' , function ( req , res ){ return res . render ( 'login' ) }); app . post ( '/login' , passport . authenticate ( 'local' , { successRedirect : '/' , failureRedirect : '/login' })); The first GET route adds a /login url to our app. The route handler function calls the res.render Express method to serve up the login template, which we'll add shortly. The second POST route handles a form submission from the /login route, and passes it through to Passport. We supply a parameter to tell Passport to use our local strategy to process this authentication request. We also supply the redirects: to the main file list if authentication is successful, or back to the login page if not. There's one more bit of code to include before we add the front-end login form. We need to check if a user is successfully authenticated before they can access the file list and other functionality. To do this, we'll insert a call to an authentication check function in our app middleware. Add this code just above the app.use('/', indexRouter); line, so it's called before the routes above are served: app . use ( isAuthenticated ); Now, let's implement the reference isAuthenticated middleware. Add this function to the bottom of the app.js file: function isAuthenticated ( req , res , next ) { if ( req . isAuthenticated ()) return next (); else return res . redirect ( '/login' ); } If a user is successfully authenticated, the isAuthenticated() method, which is added by Passport to the req object, will return true . In that case, we can safely let the pipeline proceed to the next middleware function (in this case, one of the protected routes). If the authentication check comes back false , we redirect back to the login page, away from our protected pages. Now we have all the back-end pieces for authentication in place, let's add the login page and form. Add a new file called login.hbs in the views folder. Place this code into the new file: < form action = \"/login\" method = \"post\" > < div > < label > Username: </ label > < input type = \"text\" name = \"username\" /> </ div > < div > < label > Password: </ label > < input type = \"password\" name = \"password\" /> </ div > < div > < input type = \"submit\" value = \"Log In\" /> </ div > </ form > Here we're adding a very simple form to make a POST request back to our /login route, with inputs for a username and password. We're done with authentication. Commit these changes, and wait for Code Capsules to redeploy the site, then navigate over and test it out. This time, the site should prompt for your username and password (which you added to the environment variables) before letting you through to the files page. Congratulations, you have completed building a personal web drive using Code Capsules and Node.js ! Next Steps This project has some decent basic functionality, but there are many things you could add to upgrade it, such as: Add styling to make it look better Add support for sub-folders Add support for multi-file upload Add logout functionality, using the Passport logout function Add better authentication, and perhaps separate user accounts for a multi-user drive","title":"Web File Store"},{"location":"tutorials/build-a-web-file-store/#building-a-web-file-store","text":"An online file storage drive you can access from all your devices is a very useful tool.

By default, the sort function sorts the files in ascending alphabetical order. If you'd like a different sort order, you can supply a function to customise the behaviour here. The sorted files can now be returned to the browser. We call the res.render function, which specifies the Handlebars template to use as the return web page. The templates are stored in the views folder of the project. The function also accepts a data object as an argument. Handlebars then combines this data with the template to fill in the values on the page.","title":"Getting the File List"},{"location":"tutorials/build-a-web-file-store/#rendering-the-file-list","text":"Our backend route gets the file list, and passes it through to the index HTML template. Let's customise that template to display the files.

In the first line, {{title}} will be replaced with the title we specified in the return from the GET / route we added earlier. Then we set up a simple table, and use the Handlebars each function to iterate over the elements in the files array we passed from the Get / route. The Handlebars keyword {{this}} is used to reference the current file name on each iteration. You can save, commit and push your changes so far. Our code should deploy automatically on Code Capsules . After deploying, you can visit the public URL, and you should see something like this: This is good, but a little uninteresting without any files to view!","title":"Rendering the File List"},{"location":"tutorials/build-a-web-file-store/#adding-the-file-upload-route","text":"Let's add functionality to upload a file, then we'll be able to view it in the list. We'll first add an HTML upload form to the index.hbs file in the views folder. Add this code under the <h1>{{title}}</h1> line: < div > < h2 > Upload a file </ h2 > < form ref = 'uploadForm' id = 'uploadForm' action = '/' method = 'post' encType = \"multipart/form-data\" > < input type = \"file\" name = \"newFile\" /> < input type = 'submit' value = 'Upload' /> </ form > </ div > This code adds in a new HTML form, which makes a POST request to the root / (our index page) on submit. We've given the form 2 inputs: a file upload field specified by the type=\"file\" attribute, and the submit button. Note the name given to the file input - we'll need to remember this when processing the upload on the server side. Now that we have a way for the user to select a file to upload and send to the server, we need to create a route to process the submitted file. In the index.js file in the routes folder, we'll add a new HTTP route. This one will be a POST route, as we are using it to upload a new file (or resource) onto the server. Add this stub for the route in the index.js file: router . post ( '/' , function ( req , res ){ }); To handle file uploads with Express, we'll use a package that takes care of all the encoding and streaming concerns of file uploads. Open up the terminal and install the express-fileupload package using npm: npm install express-fileupload To use this package, we need to add it into the middleware of our Express server. Open up the app.js file in the root folder of the project, and import the package by adding the following require statement at the top of the file: const fileUpload = require ( 'express-fileupload' ); Now insert the package into the Express middleware pipeline by adding the following line just under the var app = express(); statement: app . use ( fileUpload ()); The express-fileupload module adds a files attribute to our req object. Through the files attribute we can access any uploads as their own objects, which are named the same as the HTML form inputs . Now we can expand on the route stub. In the index.js file, complete the POST route as follows: router . post ( '/' , function ( req , res ){ if ( ! req . files || Object . keys ( req . files ). length === 0 ) { return res . status ( 400 ). send ( 'No files were uploaded.' ); } const newFile = req . files . newFile ; const uploadPath = process . env . PERSISTENT_STORAGE_DIR + '/' + newFile . name ; newFile . mv ( uploadPath , function ( err ) { if ( err ) return res . status ( 500 ). send ( err ); return res . redirect ( '/' ); }); }); First, we check whether the files object exists on the route, and if it does exist, we check whether it has sub-objects on the list (no sub-objects means no form input fields were populated). If no files objects or sub-objects exist on the route, there is no file for the code to process, so we return early with an HTTP status 400 code and a message to the user. Status code 400 means there is an input error from the user side. Otherwise, having established that a file has been uploaded, we get the file object by referencing the same name we gave to our HTML input field ( newFile ) on the files object that the express-fileupload package added to the req object. Now that we have the file object, we can construct a path to the data capsule's location to save the file. We use the environment variable for the data capsule mount point (located in the Backend Capsule's \"Capsule Parameters\"), along with the path separator / and the name of the uploaded file. You can see all the properties available on the file object at the express-fileupload npm page . All we need to do now is to save the file to the upload path. The express-fileupload package provides the method mv on the file object to save the file to a disk location. It then calls a provided callback function when done, or if an error occurs. If we get a error back, we send an HTTP code 500 back to the client, which means that there was an error on the server side. Otherwise, if all goes well, we redirect the client to the index / page, which will call the GET route added earlier to refresh the file list on the client side. This is a good point to commit the code to Git, and test the new deployment on Code Capsules. After the capsule finishes rebuilding, navigate to the site. It should look something like this: The upload control may look slightly different depending on the web browser and operating system you use. Try choosing a file and uploading it, and you should see it appear in the browser.","title":"Adding the File Upload Route"},{"location":"tutorials/build-a-web-file-store/#downloading-a-file","text":"We've got the functionality to upload files, and to list what files are on the server. Now let's add functionality to download files. We'll add a route with the format /filename to get the requested file. We'll make use of the download functionality built into Express to send the file back to the browser. Add this route to the index.js file. router . get ( '/:filename' , function ( req , res , next ){ const filepath = process . env . PERSISTENT_STORAGE_DIR + '/' + req . params . filename ; return res . download ( filepath ); }); This sets up a GET route, with the requested filename as a parameter. Then the function constructs a path to the file, using the environment variable for the data capsule mount point, along with the path separator / and the name of the requested file. Then we call the download method on the res (result) object with the constructed path. This sends the file to the browser. Now we need a way to call this route from the front end. Open the index.hbs file in the views folder, and modify the {{this}} template in the file list table to an HTML anchor <a> tag , with the href to the route we added above. We'll also add the download attribute to the tag so that the link will not be opened in the browser, but downloaded instead. The updated file list table should look like this now: < div > < h2 > File list </ h2 > < table > < tr > < th > File Name </ th > </ tr > {{#each files}} < tr > < td > < a href = '/{{this}}' download > {{this}} </ a > </ td > </ tr > {{/each}} </ table > </ div > Commit these changes, and wait for Code Capsules to redeploy the site. If you navigate to the site now, you should see the file you uploaded earlier as a hyperlink. Clicking on the link should download the file.","title":"Downloading a File"},{"location":"tutorials/build-a-web-file-store/#deleting-a-file","text":"Now that we can upload and download files, we'll probably also need to remove files. We can use the HTTP DELETE verb on a route for this. Since the data capsule appears just like a regular file system to our code, we can use the built-in Node.js fs module here again. It has a method called unlink which deletes a file from a file system. We supply it with a path to the file, and a callback function to let us know the result of the delete file request. If we get an error, we'll send an HTTP code 500 status back to the browser, to let the browser know that an error occurred. If the delete action is successful, we'll send a status code 200 , which lets the browser know that the operation was a success. Add this code to the index.js file to implement the DELETE route: router . delete ( '/:filename' , function ( req , res ){ const filepath = process . env . PERSISTENT_STORAGE_DIR + '/' + req . params . filename ; fs . unlink ( filepath , function ( err ) { if ( err ) return res . sendStatus ( 500 ); else return res . sendStatus ( 200 ); }); }); Now let's update the front end to be able to call this route. Open the index.hbs file, and add a new header column to the file table, along with a button for each file in the new column to delete it: < div > < h2 > File list </ h2 > < table > < tr > < th > File Name </ th > < th ></ th > </ tr > {{#each files}} < tr > < td > < a href = '/{{this}}' target = \"_blank\" > {{this}} </ a > </ td > < td > < button > Delete </ button > </ td > </ tr > {{/each}} </ table > </ div > Next we'll create some front-end JavaScript code for the button to call when clicked. We'll use the browser-side fetch function to call the DELETE file route. Add this script block at the bottom of the index.hbs file: < script type = \"text/javascript\" > function deleteFile ( filename ){ var confirmation = confirm ( 'Do you really want to delete the file ' + filename + '?' ); if ( confirmation === true ){ fetch ( '/' + filename , { method : 'DELETE' }) . then ( response => location . reload ()) . catch ( error => alert ( 'Error deleting the file! ' + error )); } } < /script> This adds a new function deleteFile to the front-end index page. It has one argument: the name of the file to delete. First, we make use of the built-in confirm function which exists in all browsers. This brings up a dialog box with the message Do you really want to delete the file? , just to make sure the user didn't click the delete button accidentally. If the user clicks \"Yes\", the dialog box returns a true value. Then we call our DELETE route using fetch . We need to pass in the route to call, and we also send an init object which specifies that the DELETE HTTP verb must be used to call this route. The fetch function returns a promise . This is an alternative to callbacks. If the call was successful, the code in the .then() handler is called. This reloads the page, so that the file listing is updated to show that the file is now deleted. If the call fails, the code in the catch handler is called. This uses another standard browser dialog, an alert , to let the user know that something went wrong. Now let's hook this function up to the button we added for each file. We'll use the onclick event on the buttons to call the function, along with the filename to be deleted. Update the button code like this: < button onclick = \"deleteFile('{{this}}')\" > Delete </ button > Commit these changes, and wait for Code Capsules to redeploy the site. Then navigate to the site and try out the \"Delete\" button next to the filename.","title":"Deleting a File"},{"location":"tutorials/build-a-web-file-store/#adding-authentication","text":"We've created the basic functions of a web drive, but anyone can get to the site and upload, download or delete documents. We need a way to control access. For this tutorial, we'll implement a very simple access control system that only allows access to one pre-defined user. We're going to use Passport to handle our access control. Passport is a modular package that allows for very simple authentication schemes to very elaborate ones, so you can upgrade the security of this app as you need. Our basic access control scheme is a username and password combination, entered on an HTML form that is posted to a login route. A session cookie will remember the logged-in user while they use the site, and we'll use the package express-session to manage the session. Passport's local strategy plugin will enable our username and password scheme. Let's start by installing all these packages and plugins. Type the following in the terminal: npm install passport passport-local express-session Now add references to these packages to the top section of the app.js file. A good place to add them is after the var logger = require('morgan'); line. Here's the code you'll need: var passport = require ( 'passport' ); var LocalStrategy = require ( 'passport-local' ). Strategy ; var session = require ( \"express-session\" ); The first thing to add to the app is the session middleware, then the Passport authentication middleware. Add the following after the app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'))); line: app . use ( session ({ secret : \"<YOUR_SECRET>\" })); app . use ( passport . initialize ()); app . use ( passport . session ()); This inserts the session middleware into the app pipeline, to read and write persistent sessions to the app cookie. Replace the <YOUR_SECRET> parameter with a string of your choosing. This secret is used to sign the session information in the cookie. Normally, this is kept very secret, as anyone who has access to the secret could construct a session cookie that looks legitimate to the server and give them access to any account on the server. You can also add an environment variable to store this secret, rather than store it in the code repo. Next, we initialize Passport into the middleware pipeline, and add in the code for Passport to use sessions to check and record authentication. When using sessions with Passport, we need to implement serialisation and deserialisation of user objects from session information, so that Passport can add the user object to the req object in the app pipeline. Add these functions to the bottom of the app.js file: passport . serializeUser ( function ( user , done ) { process . nextTick ( function (){ done ( null , user ); }); }); passport . deserializeUser ( function ( user , done ) { process . nextTick ( function (){ done ( null , user ); }); }); In our case, since we are implementing a super-simple authentication scheme with just one user, we don't need to call out to a database or other store to get user information. In fact, since there is no real user information that is of use to our app at the moment, we just return the user object that Passport sends to us straight back, as we don't really have a use for it. Even though we are doing nothing with the information, we need to register these functions with Passport, as it calls them regardless. Now we can set up the rest of the logic for Passport. Add this code just above the serialisation code: passport . use ( new LocalStrategy ( function ( username , password , done ) { if ( username === process . env . USERNAME && password === process . env . PASSWORD ){ return done ( null , { username : process . env . USERNAME }); } else { return done ( null , false , { message : \"Incorrect username or password\" }); } }) ); This plugs in and registers the local authentication strategy module into Passport. Passport's local strategy uses a simple username and password, checked on the local server, so we'll need a function to accept a username and password for validation. The function checks if entered credentials are valid, and sends back a user object if they are, using the done callback. If the credentials don't checkout, the user gets an error message. Our function checks the username and password against what is stored in our environment variables. If the credentials to be checked match the credentials in our environment variables, we authenticate the user. Head over to the \"Configure\" tab on your backend Code Capsule, and add 2 new environment variables : USERNAME and PASSWORD . Supply values of your own to set your username and password, then click the \"Update Capsule\" button to save the changes. Note: While this method of storing user credentials is appropriate for a small, single-user hobby project, it is not sufficient for production with customer credentials. Look to implementing a more robust user store, with password hashing and salting, or using a third-party authentication service such as a social network or an OAuth provider Passport offers many other authentication strategies , from OAuth 2.0 strategies allowing authentication through Facebook, Google, Twitter and other OAuth 2.0 providers, to API authentication strategies such as Bearer Tokens. Now that we have set the username and password for our app, we can add the login page routes to render the login page and send the form POST with user credentials to Passport. Add these 2 routes just above the index routes ( app.use('/', indexRouter); ) in app.js : app . get ( '/login' , function ( req , res ){ return res . render ( 'login' ) }); app . post ( '/login' , passport . authenticate ( 'local' , { successRedirect : '/' , failureRedirect : '/login' })); The first GET route adds a /login url to our app. The route handler function calls the res.render Express method to serve up the login template, which we'll add shortly. The second POST route handles a form submission from the /login route, and passes it through to Passport. We supply a parameter to tell Passport to use our local strategy to process this authentication request. We also supply the redirects: to the main file list if authentication is successful, or back to the login page if not. There's one more bit of code to include before we add the front-end login form. We need to check if a user is successfully authenticated before they can access the file list and other functionality. To do this, we'll insert a call to an authentication check function in our app middleware. Add this code just above the app.use('/', indexRouter); line, so it's called before the routes above are served: app . use ( isAuthenticated ); Now, let's implement the reference isAuthenticated middleware. Add this function to the bottom of the app.js file: function isAuthenticated ( req , res , next ) { if ( req . isAuthenticated ()) return next (); else return res . redirect ( '/login' ); } If a user is successfully authenticated, the isAuthenticated() method, which is added by Passport to the req object, will return true . In that case, we can safely let the pipeline proceed to the next middleware function (in this case, one of the protected routes). If the authentication check comes back false , we redirect back to the login page, away from our protected pages. Now we have all the back-end pieces for authentication in place, let's add the login page and form. Add a new file called login.hbs in the views folder. Place this code into the new file: < form action = \"/login\" method = \"post\" > < div > < label > Username: </ label > < input type = \"text\" name = \"username\" /> </ div > < div > < label > Password: </ label > < input type = \"password\" name = \"password\" /> </ div > < div > < input type = \"submit\" value = \"Log In\" /> </ div > </ form > Here we're adding a very simple form to make a POST request back to our /login route, with inputs for a username and password. We're done with authentication. Commit these changes, and wait for Code Capsules to redeploy the site, then navigate over and test it out. This time, the site should prompt for your username and password (which you added to the environment variables) before letting you through to the files page.

If you want to host an HTMx and Flask application on our PaaS, you can find a short deployment guide here that uses the same project.] Recent trends in the modern web saw single page frameworks like React.js and Angular take over traditional multipage websites, mainly due to the lack of interactivity offered by HTML. It is worth noting however, that single page applications (SPAs) brought this interactivity at the cost of added complexity. This is where a new HTML extension called HTMx enters and shines. HTMx gives traditional HTML sites more interactivity while keeping things simple, as it allows you to make requests from any HTML element and not just <a> and <form> tags. But this is not HTMx\u2019s only benefit. Other benefits include: Making it possible to perform partial page reloads in HTML Support for PUT and DELETE methods in addition to GET and POST Not being limited to click and submit event triggers only Lightweight set up \u2013 no additional dependencies need to be installed to get it working In this tutorial, we\u2019ll explore the benefits of HTMx by building a full stack application using Flask and HTMx. Our application will be a book recommendation app that supports CRUD functionality. The final app will look a bit like this: Overview and Requirements After building our application, you\u2019ll want to deploy it to production so you can show it to friends and family. You will therefore need the following to complete the tutorial: Git set up and installed, and a registered GitHub account Python 3 installed An IDE or text editor of your choice Setting up the Project With all the requirements in place, we can go ahead and set up our project. Let\u2019s start by creating the project folder and then we can set up a virtual environment within the project folder. Create Project Folder Let\u2019s create a folder to house our application\u2019s source code. Run the commands below in the terminal to create the folder and navigate into it. mkdir flask-htmx cd flask-htmx From here onwards, the flask-htmx directory will be referred to as the project\u2019s root folder. Creating a Virtual Environment A virtual environment allows you to isolate the packages required to develop Python applications from your computer system. We recommend you use a new virtual environment for every application you develop so as to not corrupt dependencies for other applications. In the terminal run the following command to create a virtual environment within the project's root folder: python3 -m venv env To activate the virtual environment, enter either of the following: MacOS source env/bin/activate Windows .\\env\\Scripts\\activate After activating the virtual environment, the name env should appear in brackets on the leftmost part of your terminal in your current line. This signals that the activation was successful. Installing Dependencies We can now install our required packages to the virtual environment we activated in the previous step. Run the command below: pip3 install flask flask-sqlalchemy gunicorn You might notice there\u2019s no dependency for HTMx in our dependency list. This is because it will be added as a script tag inside the head of our HTML templates. Initialize an Empty Git Repository While in the project\u2019s root folder, enter the command git init to initialize a git repository. This will allow you to track changes to your app as you build it. Create a .gitignore file and add the line below to it: env/ This excludes the env folder from being tracked by Git, as we only want to track changes in our project files. Linking to GitHub Head over to GitHub and create a new repository. Then, in your project's root folder, run the command below from the terminal, replacing username and repository_name with your own values from GitHub. git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository_name.git This will link your local repository to the one on GitHub. Building the HTMx Frontend With the set up complete, we can now begin building our app. We will start with the HTMx frontend, and for this you need to create an app/templates folder inside the project\u2019s root folder. Next, create an index.html file inside the templates folder, and populate it with the code below: <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < title > Flask HTMX ALPINE App </ title > < link href = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\" rel = \"stylesheet\" integrity = \"sha384-giJF6kkoqNQ00vy+HMDP7azOuL0xtbfIcaT9wjKHr8RbDVddVHyTfAAsrekwKmP1\" crossorigin = \"anonymous\" > <!-- HTMX --> < script src = \"https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.5.0\" ></ script > < style > body { padding : 20 px ; } table { font-family : arial , sans-serif ; border-collapse : collapse ; width : 100 % ; } tr . htmx-swapping td { opacity : 0 ; transition : opacity 0.5 s ease-out ; } td , th { border : 1 px solid #383737 ; text-align : left ; padding : 8 px ; } tr : nth-child ( even ) { background-color : #dddddd ; } </ style > </ head > <!-- Place <body> </body> code here --> </ html > There\u2019s not much going on in the code snippet above, except for line 5 and 8, which are responsible for loading Bootstrap and HTMx into our index.html page. This gives you the power to build an interactive page just by including the <script> tag that links to HTMx, without needing to install any npm packages like with most SPAs. This is how HTMx allows you to build sites that are more lightweight compared to SPA frameworks. The code in between the <style> tag adds CSS to style our frontend to make it more visually appealing. Now let\u2019s add code that will be rendered in the body tag of our page. Copy and paste the code below underneath the </head> tag: < body > < h1 > Book Recommendations </ h1 > < form hx-post = \"/submit\" hx-swap = \"beforeend\" hx-target = \"#new-book\" class = \"mb-3\" > < input type = \"text\" placeholder = \"Book Title\" name = \"title\" class = \"form-control mb-3\" /> < input type = \"text\" placeholder = \"Book Author\" name = \"author\" class = \"form-control mb-3\" /> < button type = \"submit\" class = \"btn btn-primary\" > Submit </ button > </ form > < table class = \"table\" > < thead > < tr > < th scope = \"col\" > Book Title </ th > < th scope = \"col\" > Book Author </ th > </ tr > </ thead > < tbody id = \"new-book\" hx-target = \"closest tr\" hx-swap = \"outerHTML swap:0.5s\" > {%for book in books%} < tr > < td > {{book.Book.title}} </ td > < td > {{book.Author.name}} </ td > < td > < button class = \"btn btn-primary\" hx-get = \"/get-edit-form/{{book.Book.book_id}}\" > Edit Title </ button > </ td > < td > < button hx-delete = \"/delete/{{book.Book.book_id}}\" class = \"btn btn-primary\" > Delete </ button > </ td > </ tr > {%endfor%} </ tbody > </ table > </ body > There are a couple of attributes here that aren\u2019t used in traditional HTML. Let\u2019s go over them one by one: hx-[http method] \u2013 Examples of this attribute include hx-post , hx-get , hx-put and hx-delete . This is the HTMx way of denoting what type of request should be sent on form submission or when a request firing event is triggered. These attributes accept the request route as an argument. In the case of our form, we use the /submit route, while the table buttons send requests to the /delete and /get-edit-form routes. hx-target \u2013 This attribute accepts the id of the element you want to update after a successful request or when an event is triggered. Take note of the preceding # that\u2019s written before the id value. You might have noticed that we didn\u2019t use an id value in the table, but used a value of closest tr instead. This swaps the closest table row with the HTML that will be returned by the request when an action is triggered. The closest row will always be the same row in which an event or request was triggered, either by the \u201cEdit Title\u201d button or the \u201cDelete\u201d button. hx-swap \u2013 The hx-swap attribute allows you to specify how you want to partially reload the page or swap elements with new ones. It updates the UI in the section specified in the hx-target attribute. In our form, we used the beforeend value to tell HTMx that we want to append the result of the request after the last child in the target element, which is the table with id=new-book . In the table however, we used the outerHTML value to denote that we want to swap the entire <tr> element with the returned content. A full list of acceptable hx-swap values can be viewed here . Building the Flask Backend We can now dive into building the backend of our app. Start by creating a run.py file in the project\u2019s root folder and populate it with the code below: from app import app if __name__ == \"__main__\" : app . run () This is the point of entry for any server wishing to run our app. Declare and Initialize app Module Create an __init__.py file in the app folder and populate it with the code below: from flask import Flask from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy app = Flask ( __name__ ) app . config [ \"SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI\" ] = 'sqlite:///sqlite.db' app . config [ \"SQLALCHEMY_ECHO\" ] = False app . config [ \"SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS\" ] = False db = SQLAlchemy ( app ) from app import views from app import models db . init_app ( app ) db . create_all () Here we declare our app object using the Flask package we installed earlier. We\u2019ll be using a SQLite database, which we configure using the app.config lines. We use SQLAlchemy to declare the database object we\u2019ll interact with, as it allows us to read and write to the database using object notation, which is more familiar than raw SQL statements. It is important to import the models only after declaring the database object so that their respective tables are included in the database when it\u2019s created. The last two lines handle the initialization of the database and the creation of all relevant tables in the database based on the models that are imported. Register App Models The next step is to create the models.py module we imported earlier in the __init__.py file. Create a file named models.py inside the app folder and populate it with the code below: from app import db class Author ( db . Model ): author_id = db . Column ( db . Integer , primary_key = True ) name = db . Column ( db . String ) books = db . relationship ( \"Book\" , backref = \"author\" ) def __repr__ ( self ): return '<Author: {} >' . format ( self . books ) class Book ( db . Model ): book_id = db . Column ( db . Integer , primary_key = True ) author_id = db . Column ( db . Integer , db . ForeignKey ( \"author.author_id\" )) title = db . Column ( db . String ) Here we declare the two models we\u2019re going to be saving in our database, which are Author and Book . It is worth noting the one-to-many relationship between \"author\" and \"books\", as an author can have many Books but each book can only have a single author in the context of this application. We denote this relationship by using a foreign key in the author_id field of the book and a backref in the books field of an author. Create Views The last part in building the backend of our app is to create the views or routes that the frontend will be interacting with. Create a views.py file inside the app folder and add the code below to it: from app import app , db from flask import render_template , request , jsonify from app.models import Author , Book @app . route ( \"/\" , methods = [ \"GET\" ]) def home (): books = db . session . query ( Book , Author ) . filter ( Book . author_id == Author . author_id ) . all () return render_template ( \"index.html\" , books = books ) In the code snippet above, we\u2019ve added the index route and bound the home function to it. The home function first queries the database to get a list of all books before returning the index.html template that\u2019s populated with the list of books. Add the code below to add the /submit route to our app\u2019s views.py file: @app . route ( \"/submit\" , methods = [ \"POST\" ]) def submit (): global_book_object = Book () title = request . form [ \"title\" ] author_name = request . form [ \"author\" ] author_exists = db . session . query ( Author ) . filter ( Author . name == author_name ) . first () print ( author_exists ) # check if author already exists in db if author_exists : author_id = author_exists . author_id book = Book ( author_id = author_id , title = title ) db . session . add ( book ) db . session . commit () global_book_object = book else : author = Author ( name = author_name ) db . session . add ( author ) db . session . commit () book = Book ( author_id = author . author_id , title = title ) db . session . add ( book ) db . session . commit () global_book_object = book response = f \"\"\" <tr> <td> { title } </td> <td> { author_name } </td> <td> <button class=\"btn btn-primary\" hx-get=\"/get-edit-form/ { global_book_object . book_id } \"> Edit Title </button> </td> <td> <button hx-delete=\"/delete/ { global_book_object . book_id } \" class=\"btn btn-primary\"> Delete </button> </td> </tr> \"\"\" return response When a person submits a new book, this is the route that\u2019s called. The logic first checks if the author already exists in the database and if so, saves the book with the author\u2019s author_id . Otherwise, it creates a new author and then saves the book. As HTMx expects an HTML response, the submit method responds with an HTML table row that updates the list of books on the frontend. The new entry will be for the recently added book. Next, let\u2019s add the code for the /delete route. Copy and paste the code below: @app . route ( \"/delete/<int:id>\" , methods = [ \"DELETE\" ]) def delete_book ( id ): book = Book . query . get ( id ) db . session . delete ( book ) db . session . commit () return \"\" The first thing you may have noticed about this route is the id query parameter it accepts. This allows us to know which object to delete. After deleting the book, we return an empty string, which causes the row we deleted in the frontend to disappear, as it is swapped for \u201cnothing\u201d. We now have routes for creating, reading, and deleting books. It\u2019s time to add views associated with updating book entries in order to complete our app\u2019s CRUD functionality. Add the code below to views.py to add logic for updating book entries to your app: @app . route ( \"/get-edit-form/<int:id>\" , methods = [ \"GET\" ]) def get_edit_form ( id ): book = Book . query . get ( id ) author = Author . query . get ( book . author_id ) response = f \"\"\" <tr hx-trigger='cancel' class='editing' hx-get=\"/get-book-row/ { id } \"> <td><input name=\"title\" value=\" { book . title } \"/></td> <td> { author . name } </td> <td> <button class=\"btn btn-primary\" hx-get=\"/get-book-row/ { id } \"> Cancel </button> <button class=\"btn btn-primary\" hx-put=\"/update/ { id } \" hx-include=\"closest tr\"> Save </button> </td> </tr> \"\"\" return response @app . route ( \"/get-book-row/<int:id>\" , methods = [ \"GET\" ]) def get_book_row ( id ): book = Book . query . get ( id ) author = Author . query . get ( book . author_id ) response = f \"\"\" <tr> <td> { book . title } </td> <td> { author . name } </td> <td> <button class=\"btn btn-primary\" hx-get=\"/get-edit-form/ { id } \"> Edit Title </button> </td> <td> <button hx-delete=\"/delete/ { id } \" class=\"btn btn-primary\"> Delete </button> </td> </tr> \"\"\" return response @app . route ( \"/update/<int:id>\" , methods = [ \"PUT\" ]) def update_book ( id ): db . session . query ( Book ) . filter ( Book . book_id == id ) . update ({ \"title\" : request . form [ \"title\" ]}) db . session . commit () title = request . form [ \"title\" ] book = Book . query . get ( id ) author = Author . query . get ( book . author_id ) response = f \"\"\" <tr> <td> { title } </td> <td> { author . name } </td> <td> <button class=\"btn btn-primary\" hx-get=\"/get-edit-form/ { id } \"> Edit Title </button> </td> <td> <button hx-delete=\"/delete/ { id } \" class=\"btn btn-primary\"> Delete </button> </td> </tr> \"\"\" return response There\u2019s more than one view for the update logic, and we\u2019ll see why shortly. The /get-edit-form route is called when a user clicks on the \u201cEdit Title\u201d button on the frontend, and it returns a form for updating the selected book. If the user decides to cancel this action, the /get-book-row route is called and it returns a table row with the unedited book entry. If the user goes through with updating the book title, then the /update route is called. The update_book function that\u2019s bound to the /update route will update the book title based on the id supplied to it as a query parameter. When the update is complete, the method returns an HTML table row with the updated book title. Running our App Our app is ready to be tested. Navigate to the project\u2019s root folder in a terminal and run the following command: python3 run.py . This should start up a development server on port 5000. Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and you should see your app running: Once you are satisfied with the app, you can commit and push your changes to GitHub with the following commands. git add . git commit -m 'commit message' git push origin We\u2019ve shown you how to build a full stack Flask HTMx application from scratch and you should be able to deploy this basic version, but you may like to consider adding more functionality to enhance our app\u2019s features.

If you want to host an HTMx and Flask application on our PaaS, you can find a short deployment guide here that uses the same project.] Recent trends in the modern web saw single page frameworks like React.js and Angular take over traditional multipage websites, mainly due to the lack of interactivity offered by HTML. It is worth noting however, that single page applications (SPAs) brought this interactivity at the cost of added complexity. This is where a new HTML extension called HTMx enters and shines. HTMx gives traditional HTML sites more interactivity while keeping things simple, as it allows you to make requests from any HTML element and not just <a> and <form> tags. But this is not HTMx\u2019s only benefit. Other benefits include: Making it possible to perform partial page reloads in HTML Support for PUT and DELETE methods in addition to GET and POST Not being limited to click and submit event triggers only Lightweight set up \u2013 no additional dependencies need to be installed to get it working In this tutorial, we\u2019ll explore the benefits of HTMx by building a full stack application using Flask and HTMx.

This gives you the power to build an interactive page just by including the <script> tag that links to HTMx, without needing to install any npm packages like with most SPAs. This is how HTMx allows you to build sites that are more lightweight compared to SPA frameworks. The code in between the <style> tag adds CSS to style our frontend to make it more visually appealing. Now let\u2019s add code that will be rendered in the body tag of our page. Copy and paste the code below underneath the </head> tag: < body > < h1 > Book Recommendations </ h1 > < form hx-post = \"/submit\" hx-swap = \"beforeend\" hx-target = \"#new-book\" class = \"mb-3\" > < input type = \"text\" placeholder = \"Book Title\" name = \"title\" class = \"form-control mb-3\" /> < input type = \"text\" placeholder = \"Book Author\" name = \"author\" class = \"form-control mb-3\" /> < button type = \"submit\" class = \"btn btn-primary\" > Submit </ button > </ form > < table class = \"table\" > < thead > < tr > < th scope = \"col\" > Book Title </ th > < th scope = \"col\" > Book Author </ th > </ tr > </ thead > < tbody id = \"new-book\" hx-target = \"closest tr\" hx-swap = \"outerHTML swap:0.5s\" > {%for book in books%} < tr > < td > {{book.Book.title}} </ td > < td > {{book.Author.name}} </ td > < td > < button class = \"btn btn-primary\" hx-get = \"/get-edit-form/{{book.Book.book_id}}\" > Edit Title </ button > </ td > < td > < button hx-delete = \"/delete/{{book.Book.book_id}}\" class = \"btn btn-primary\" > Delete </ button > </ td > </ tr > {%endfor%} </ tbody > </ table > </ body > There are a couple of attributes here that aren\u2019t used in traditional HTML. Let\u2019s go over them one by one: hx-[http method] \u2013 Examples of this attribute include hx-post , hx-get , hx-put and hx-delete . This is the HTMx way of denoting what type of request should be sent on form submission or when a request firing event is triggered. These attributes accept the request route as an argument. In the case of our form, we use the /submit route, while the table buttons send requests to the /delete and /get-edit-form routes. hx-target \u2013 This attribute accepts the id of the element you want to update after a successful request or when an event is triggered. Take note of the preceding # that\u2019s written before the id value. You might have noticed that we didn\u2019t use an id value in the table, but used a value of closest tr instead. This swaps the closest table row with the HTML that will be returned by the request when an action is triggered. The closest row will always be the same row in which an event or request was triggered, either by the \u201cEdit Title\u201d button or the \u201cDelete\u201d button. hx-swap \u2013 The hx-swap attribute allows you to specify how you want to partially reload the page or swap elements with new ones. It updates the UI in the section specified in the hx-target attribute. In our form, we used the beforeend value to tell HTMx that we want to append the result of the request after the last child in the target element, which is the table with id=new-book . In the table however, we used the outerHTML value to denote that we want to swap the entire <tr> element with the returned content.

Like other full stack applications, a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack has the advantage of needing only one capsule to host both the frontend and backend of an application. In this tutorial, we'll extend a boilerplate MERN application to make a job board where users can view and submit available jobs. Getting Started Head over to the MERN stack deployment guide and follow the steps outlined there to set up the boilerplate application. You will need to clone the forked repository to your local development environment to extend the functionality of the boilerplate application. Before we can view the application's frontend, we need to install the node_modules for the backend and set a local DATABASE_URL environment variable similar to the one on Code Capsules. Navigate to the project's root folder in a terminal or command prompt window and run npm install there. Reference this MongoDB setup guide to ensure that public access is turned on for your data capsule. Copy the value of the connection string and append &authSource=admin to it so that its format is similar to mongodb://09229f61-205e-1:325368d6-3c25-e@data-capsule-ndulvw.codecapsules.co.za:27017/app?ssl=true&authSource=admin . Set the local DATABASE_URL environment variable by following the steps below: Create a .env file in the root folder. Add the line below to the .env file replacing the connection string with your own. DATABASE_URL=mongodb://09229f61-205e-1:325368d6-3c25-e@data-capsule-ndulvw.codecapsules.co.za:27017/app?ssl=true&authSource=admin Run the command below in a terminal window from the root folder to install the package for loading environment variables. npm install dotenv Open the index.js file in the root folder and add the following line just below the other require statements. require('dotenv').config(); Extending the Frontend Open the project\u2019s root folder and navigate to the client directory. This is where you'll find the code for the React frontend in the src subdirectory. Open a terminal and run npm install from the client directory to install the node_modules required by the frontend code. Next, type in npm run build . This command creates a build folder with an optimized version of our frontend source code. This code has all the extra spacing removed, which is great for efficiency but impossible for humans to read or edit. An excerpt is shown below: a=document.createElement(\"script\");a.charset=\"utf-8\",a.timeout=120,i.nc&&a.setAttribute(\"nonce\",i.nc),a.src=function(e){return i.p+\"static/js/\"+({}[e]||e)+\".\"+{3:\"fe1e148c\"}[e]+\".chunk.js\"}(e);var c=new Error;u=function(r){a.onerror=a.onload=null,clearTimeout(f);var t=o[e];if(0!==t){if(t){var n=r&&(\"load\"===r.type?\"missing\":r.type),u=r&&r.target&&r.target.src; Whenever we make changes to our application's frontend code, we edit the files in the src directory and use the npm run build command to create the optimized code in the build directory, which will be executed when we load our application in a web browser. Run node index.js in the terminal from the project's root folder to start the boilerplate MERN application. You can view it in your browser at http://localhost:8080 . The app should look something like this: Let's extend this frontend to reflect the job board functionality.

Create a submitJob.js file in the components folder and add the following code: import React , { useState } from 'react' import axios from 'axios' const SubmitJob = () => { const [ jobTitle , setJobTitle ] = useState ( \"\" ) const [ jobDescription , setJobDescription ] = useState ( \"\" ) const [ jobLocation , setJobLocation ] = useState ( \"\" ) const [ jobSalary , setJobSalary ] = useState ( null ) const postJob = ( e ) => { const data = { title : jobTitle , description : jobDescription , location : jobLocation , salary : jobSalary } axios . post ( '/api/jobs/' , data ) . then ( response => { console . log ( response ) }) } return ( < div className = \"submitJobContainer\" > < h3 > Submit a Job < /h3> < form className = \"formContainer\" onSubmit = { postJob } > < input type = \"text\" name = \"title\" placeholder = \"Job Title\" onChange = { e => setJobTitle ( e . target . value )} /> < input type = \"text\" name = \"description\" placeholder = \"Job Description\" onChange = { e => setJobDescription ( e . target . value )} /> < input type = \"text\" name = \"location\" placeholder = \"Job Location\" onChange = { e => setJobLocation ( e . target . value )} /> < input type = \"number\" name = \"salary\" placeholder = \"Job Salary\" onChange = { e => setJobSalary ( e . target . value )} /> < button className = \"submitButton\" type = \"submit\" > Submit < /button> < /form> < /div> ) } export default SubmitJob The SubmitJob component uses state to keep track of the job field values as they are entered by a user. You can add more state variables to capture more job fields in your application. When the user clicks \"Submit\", the postJob method posts the job field values to the endpoint specified in the axios.post() method. Notice that we use the relative URL /api/jobs/ in the post request, since the frontend will be hosted at the same URL as the backend. Adding the ViewJobs Component Create a viewJobs.js file in the components folder and add the following code to it: import React , { useState , useEffect } from 'react' import axios from 'axios' const ViewJobs = () => { const [ jobsStateArray , setJobsStateArray ] = useState ([]) useEffect (() => { axios . get ( '/api/jobs/' ) . then ( response => { console . log ( response ) setJobsStateArray ( response . data ) }) }, []) return ( < div className = \"viewJobsContainer\" > < h3 > View Available Jobs < /h3> { jobsStateArray . map (( item , index ) => { return ( < div className = \"jobCard\" > < p >< strong > Job Title < /strong>: {item.title}</p> < p >< strong > Location < /strong>: {item.location}</p> < p >< strong > Description < /strong>: {item.description}</p> < p >< strong > Salary < /strong>: {item.salary}</p> < /div> ) })} < /div> ) } export default ViewJobs The ViewJobs component uses the useEffect hook to fetch available jobs as soon as the page loads. After fetching the jobs, they are stored in the jobsStateArray before being displayed using the map function. Viewing the Frontend We need to import the two components we have just created in src/App.js before we can see the changes we just made. Open App.js and replace its contents with this code: import logo from './logo.svg' ; import './App.css' ; import React , { useState } from 'react' ; import axios from 'axios' ; import SubmitJob from './components/submitJob' ; import ViewJobs from './components/viewJobs' ; function App () { return ( < div className = \"App\" > < header className = \"App-header\" > < img src = { logo } className = \"App-logo\" alt = \"logo\" /> < h3 > Job Board < /h3> < /header> < SubmitJob /> < ViewJobs /> < /div> ); } export default App ; Here, we're importing the SubmitJob and ViewJobs components so that they can be rendered when React displays the contents of App.js . Now you can run npm run build again from the client directory to build the app, then open your browser to take a look at the extended frontend. You'll notice the page layout has changed, but the styling is a bit off. Add the contents of this CSS file to src/App.css to make our frontend prettier. When you rebuild your application and take a look at the frontend, it should look like this: Extending the Backend We\u2019re now ready to extend the backend to include functionality for the addition and retrieval of jobs on the job board. Adding the Job Model Let\u2019s define our job model to declare which job fields we want to save. Open app/models/index.js and replace its contents with this code: const dbConfig = require ( \"../config/db-config.js\" ); const mongoose = require ( \"mongoose\" ); mongoose . Promise = global . Promise ; const db = {}; db . mongoose = mongoose ; db . url = dbConfig . url ; db . jobs = require ( \"./job.model.js\" )( mongoose ); module . exports = db ; Here we create and export a db variable that we'll use to access the database. We'll use the Mongoose library to handle all communication with our MongoDB database. Now create a file named job.model.js in the models folder to define the fields and field types of the job model. Populate it with the code below. If you added more fields to your frontend SubmitJob component, remember to add them here too, or they won\u2019t be saved when a user submits a job. module . exports = mongoose => { var schema = mongoose . Schema ( { title : String , description : String , location : String , salary : Number }, { timestamps : true } ); schema . method ( \"toJSON\" , function () { const { __v , _id , ... object } = this . toObject (); object . id = _id ; return object ; }); const Job = mongoose . model ( \"job\" , schema ); return Job ; }; By default, Mongoose adds an _id property to ObjectId fields. The schema.method() function makes sure the name of the ObjectId field is just id , which is the name our frontend expects. Delete the person.model.js file that came with the boilerplate project as we won\u2019t be needing it. Adding Job Controllers The next step is to create controllers to decide whether the app is reading or writing jobs to the database. In the app/controllers/ folder, create a file named job.controller.js and add the following code to it: const db = require ( \"../models\" ); const Job = db . jobs ; // Create and Save a new Job exports . create = ( req , res ) => { // Validate request if ( ! req . body . title ) { res . status ( 400 ). send ({ message : \"Content can not be empty!\" }); return ; } // Create a Job const job = new Job ({ title : req . body . title , description : req . body . description , location : req . body . location , salary : req . body . salary }); // Save Job in the database job . save ( job ) . then ( data => { res . send ( data ); }) . catch ( err => { res . status ( 500 ). send ({ message : err . message || \"Some error occurred while creating the Job.\" }); }); }; // Retrieve all Jobs from the database. exports . findAll = ( req , res ) => { const title = req . query . title ; var condition = title ? { title : { $regex : new RegExp ( title ), $options : \"i\" } } : {}; Job . find ( condition ) . then ( data => { res . send ( data ); }) . catch ( err => { res . status ( 500 ). send ({ message : err . message || \"Some error occurred while retrieving Jobs.\" }); }); }; The create export is responsible for creating a new job object using the job model and saving it to the database. The findAll export retrieves all jobs that were previously submitted. Delete the person.controller.js file that came with the boilerplate project as we won\u2019t be needing it. Adding Endpoints The last step in extending the backend is to add endpoints for the frontend to make post and get requests to. Create a job.routes.js file in the app/routes/ folder and add the following code: module . exports = app => { const jobs = require ( \"../controllers/job.controller.js\" ); var router = require ( \"express\" ). Router (); // Create a new Job router . post ( \"/\" , jobs . create ); // Retrieve all Jobs router . get ( \"/\" , jobs . findAll ); app . use ( '/api/jobs' , router ); }; The routes use request methods and the controller exports we made earlier to decide what happens when each endpoint is hit by a get or post request. Delete the person.routes.js file that was in the routes folder. In index.js in the root folder of the project, find the following line: require ( \"./app/routes/person.routes\" )( app ); and change it to: require ( \"./app/routes/job.routes\" )( app ); This tells our backend to use the routes defined in our job.routes.js file. Integrating the Frontend and Backend Our Express backend uses the contents of the client/build folder to render the frontend of our MERN stack application. The lines below in the index.js file in the root folder handle that responsibility: const path = __dirname + '/client/build/' ; const app = express (); app . use ( express . static ( path )); Using Version Control We'll use version control to keep track of the new files we added when we were extending our application. We don't want to track the build folder in git (the frontend will rebuild when we deploy to Code Capsules), so we'll add this folder to be ignored in the .gitignore file in the project's root folder, like this: /client/build Git Add To add all the new files we created, run the command below in the root folder of the project. git add -A Git Commit Next, we need to commit the files we just added to our repository. To do this, run this command: git commit -m \"Added job board files\" Git Push The final step is to push our committed changes to the remote repository which Code Capsules is linked to. Run the command below to push the changes we just made: git push origin main Code Capsules automatically deploys the new version of your application as soon as you push to the deploy branch, which is main in this case. That\u2019s it, your job board should be fully functional now.","title":"MERN Job Board"},{"location":"tutorials/build-mern-job-board/#build-a-mern-job-board","text":"A video for this tutorial can be found here if you prefer watching to reading.

Many developers find themselves using it almost constantly when working on projects. One of the stand out features of Slack is the rich API it exposes, to allow developers to integrate with it. In this tutorial, we'll use the Slack API to give our apps a voice. We'll be able to talk to our apps running on Code Capsules, to ask their status and see if they are up and running. They will also be able to alert us when they boot up, so we know if they have been successfully deployed or restarted. Overview and Requirements As we're building a Slackbot, you'll need to sign up for an account on Slack , if you haven't already got one. Ideally, for this tutorial you should use a Slack workspace that you can safely send many test messages to while we are creating this bot, without disturbing people. We'll also need the following: Git set up and installed, and a registered GitHub account. Node.js installed. A registered Code Capsules account. An IDE or text editor to create the project in. This tutorial was made using Visual Studio Code , but feel free to use any tool you like. Setting Up the Project With our requirements in place, we can get started on setting them up to work as needed for our Slackbot project. Create a new repo on GitHub We need a place to store our code from which Code Capsules can deploy to a capsule. A repository on GitHub is just what we need. Head over to GitHub, and create a new repo. We're calling it slackbot here, but you can call it whatever you like. Note: You can also add this code to an existing backend project if you would like to monitor it; perhaps something you built in an earlier tutorial. Initialise the base project Now we can get some base code set up. Let's start by cloning the new GitHub repo onto our local computer. Now, go into the directory of the repo you've just cloned. We can initialise a new Node.js project by typing the following at the terminal (or command prompt, if you're on Windows): npm init We can just press enter for each of the questions it asks; the defaults are good to start with. Install our packages Now that we have our project initialised, we can add the packages we need to create our bot. These are: Express : This acts as our web server and HTTP request router. We'll use this to route requests from Slack to the correct logic. body-parser : This interprets and parses payload data from HTTP requests. We'll need this to parse the URL-encoded data Slack sends to us with a request. superagent : This package allows us to make outgoing HTTP requests. We'll need this to send a message to Slack. Let's type in the following at the terminal to install the packages: npm install express body-parser superagent Now let's create an index.js file, which will be the main file for our app. A simple way to do this is to open up your project folder in an editor, like Visual Studio Code . Now you can create a new index.js file. Save this blank file. Great, it's time to push this boilerplate project up to Git. We can do it from the terminal with the following: git add . git commit -am 'added base files for project' git push origin Create a new Code Capsule We'll need a place to host our app. Log in to Code Capsules , and create a Team and Space as necessary. Link Code Capsules to the GitHub repository you created earlier. You can do this by clicking your username at the top right, and choosing \"Edit Profile\". Now click the \"GitHub\" button to link to a repo. Create a new Capsule, selecting the \"Backend\" capsule type. Select the GitHub repository you created above. If you are only using the repo for this project, you can leave the \"Repo Subpath\" field empty. You may need to add your repo to the team repo if you haven't already. Click the \"Modify Team Repos\" to do so. Click \"Next\", then on the following page, click \"Create Capsule\". Register an app on Slack After you've created a workspace on Slack, or logged into an existing one, head over to https://api.slack.com and click on \"Create a custom app\". On the dialog that comes up, we can give our app a name, and choose which workspace we want to add it to. You can choose any name you wish \u2013 we've used Serverbot here. Now we can click \"Create App\". Great! We've created our app. Now we can configure it. For this tutorial, we would like the following two functions: Our Code Capsules app should automatically send us a notification whenever it starts up. This allows us to easily know when a new deployment is successful. It can also alert us to any potential crashes and restarts. We want to query our Code Capsules app from Slack at any time to see how it's doing. Our first requirement can be configured on the Slack side by clicking \"OAuth & Permissions\" on the left panel. Scroll down to the Scopes section, and click \"Add an OAuth Scope\" under the Bot Token Scopes section, and choose \"Chat:Write\" from the options list. This now allows our bot to initiate and post messages to us when it starts up. Our second requirement can be configured by setting up a slash command . Click on the \"Slash Commands\" menu item on the left, under Features . Then click \"Create a new Command\". We'll give the command the name /stats . For the Request URL , copy the Domain name from your Code Capsules Overview page. Paste your domain into the Request URL box on Slack, and add /slack/command/stats to the end of it. We can fill in a description as well, something like 'Returns key stats from the app'. Great, now we can click \"Save\" at the bottom of the page to finish setting up our slash command. Writing the Slackbot Code Now that we have all our systems set up, we can get onto the coding part. Adding the base code Let's add the boilerplate code to startup a new Express server. Open up the index.js file and add the following: const express = require ( 'express' ); const app = express (); let port = process . env . PORT || 3000 ; app . listen ( port , ()=>{ console . log ( `App listening on port ${ port } ` ); }); Sending a startup message to Slack Ok, cool, we've got the base code to create an Express app, and start it up to begin listening for requests. Now we can add some code to send a message to Slack when it boots up, not just locally to the console. If we look at the docs on Slack , we see that we can POST to the endpoint https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage to send a message. In their example, they specify that we need: 1. An access token. 2. The channel ID of the channel to post the message to. 3. The message we want to post as the requirements. To get the access token, head over to your app dashboard on Slack, and click on the \"OAuth & Permissions\" menu item on the left-hand side. Then click the \"Install to Workspace\" button, and then the \"Allow\" button. After this, you should see a newly generated \"Bot User OAuth Token\". Copy this token \u2013 this is our access token. We could just put this token in our code. However, this is not really considered best practice for sensitive secrets and credentials. Rather, let's add this secret as an Environment Variable , and access it from the Node.js process object, on the .env property . To add the access token to the environment in Code Capsules, head over to the capsule we created earlier, and click on the \"Config\" tab. Now we can fill in our environment variable for the access token. Add a new environment variable with name SLACK_BOT_TOKEN and set the value to the token copied from Slack. Now that we've added our access token, we need to find the ID of the channel we want to post to. Find a channel on your Slack workspace that you want to send to, or create a new channel. Now we can get the channel ID by right-clicking on the channel name to bring up a context menu. Now, we can choose \"Copy Link\" from that menu: If we paste that link, we get something like https://<workspace-name>.slack.com/archives/C01SZ6Z3TCY . The last part of that URL is the channel ID; in this example case, C01SZ6Z3TCY . Let's add this to our environment variables as well, as it keeps all the configurations in one place. Head back over to your Capsule, and add in an environment variable with the name SLACK_CHANNEL_ID and set the value to the channel ID we extracted above. Click the \"Update & Start Build\" button to save the changes to the environment variables. We also need to invite our bot to the chosen channel, so that it will be able to post there. Go to the channel, and @ mention the name you gave the bot to add it. Click \"Invite Them\" when Slack prompts you. Now let's add the code to call Slack on startup, and write a message to our channel. We can modify our boilerplate code above to make the HTTP POST to the endpoint https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage. We'll use Superagent to make the call. const express = require ( 'express' ); const superagent = require ( 'superagent' ); const app = express (); let port = process . env . PORT || 3000 ; app . listen ( port , ()=>{ console . log ( `App listening on port ${ port } ` ); sendStartupMessageToSlack (); }); function sendStartupMessageToSlack (){ superagent . post ( 'https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage' ) . send ({ channel : process . env . SLACK_CHANNEL_ID , text : \"I'm alive and running\" }) . set ( 'accept' , 'json' ) . set ( 'Authorization' , 'Bearer ' + process . env . SLACK_BOT_TOKEN ) . end (( err , result ) => { }); } We've added in a function sendStartupMessageToSlack which makes the call out to Slack. Notice that we send the auth token in a header, using .set('Authorization', 'Bearer '+ process.env.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN) . The Authorization header is a standard HTTP header. The channel and the message are sent in the body. Feel free to modify the startup message from I'm alive and running to whatever you'd like. Deploying to Code Capsules This seems like a great time to test out our app on Code Capsules. But before we do that, there is one thing we have to do to make it work. We need to tell Code Capsules how to run our app. By default, Code Capsules will call npm start after deploying the code. Therefore, we just need to add a start script to our package.json file in order for our code to be run on Code Capsules. Open the package.json file. Under the scripts section, add the line \"start\": \"node index.js\" . The package.json file should look like this now: { \"name\" : \"slackbot\" , \"version\" : \"1.0.0\" , \"description\" : \"\" , \"main\" : \"index.js\" , \"scripts\" : { \"test\" : \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\" , \"start\" : \"node index.js\" }, \"author\" : \"\" , \"license\" : \"ISC\" , \"dependencies\" : { \"body-parser\" : \"^1.19.0\" , \"express\" : \"^4.17.1\" , \"superagent\" : \"^6.1.0\" } } Ok, let's save all the files we've created, add and commit, and then push to our repo. When Code Capsules sees that there is a new commit, it will automatically deploy our code. git add . git commit -am 'added code to call Slack on startup' git push origin If all goes well, in a few minutes you should get a message on your Slack channel from your code! Adding a slash command Now that our app can send us messages, can we send messages back to it? Let's implement the slash command, which will allow us to ask our app for some of its important stats and info. This time, Slack will send an HTTP POST to our app. If we take a look at the Slack docs again , we notice that Slack will send the slash command instruction to the URL we specified in the command set up earlier. We can also see that the POST payload is in the format application/x-www-form-urlencoded . We can set up a body-parser to interpret this data. Let's extend our code with the snippet below to implement the slash command receiver as specified in the Slack docs. First add a require statement for body-parser at the top. const bodyParser = require ( \"body-parser\" ); Then add the code below: app . use ( bodyParser . urlencoded ()); app . post ( '/slack/command/stats' , [ function ( req , res ){ const slackReqObj = req . body ; const packageJson = require ( './package.json' ); const current_time = new Date (); const stats = { name : packageJson . name , version : packageJson . version , environment : process . env . NODE_ENV , platform : process . platform , architecture : process . arch , node_version : process . version , pid : process . pid , current_server_time : current_time . toString (), uptime : process . uptime (), memory_usage : process . memoryUsage () }; const response = { response_type : 'in_channel' , channel : slackReqObj . channel_id , text : JSON . stringify ( stats , null , '\\t' ) }; return res . json ( response ); }]); This code listens for incoming POST calls on the line app.post('/slack/command/stats', [function(req,res){ . If we receive one, we build up a return object, consisting of various interesting stats and info. This includes the current time on the server (in case it is in a different time zone to us), the name and version of our app as set in the package.json file, and various environment and process info. Then it replies to the request in the format specified by Slack in their docs. We use the line text: JSON.stringify(stats, null, '\\t') to turn our info and stats object into a nicely formatted text string, in the style of a JSON object. Then, in the line return res.json(response); , we return all the info back to Slack to display as the response to a matching slash command. Great, now we can commit and push this code. git commit -am 'added handler for slash command' git push origin After the code has finished deploying on Code Capsules (it should send a startup message again when it's ready), we can test the slash command. Type /stats in the channel we chose earlier. After a second or two, the app should respond with its current vital stats and information. Adding verification We can ask our app via Slack (which we use constantly!) how it's doing; pretty cool, huh? There is a problem though. If we call our slash command endpoint from anywhere else, for instance if we just call it using Postman , it also returns all the information and stats! This would not be good for a production system, as sensitive information will be easily found by attackers. So how can we ensure that the request comes from our Slack workspace? Luckily, Slack has thought about this, and sends a message signature with its requests . From the guide in Slack's docs , we can put together some code to check that the request is legitimately from Slack. The main parts of the check, copied from the docs, looks like this: Retrieve the X-Slack-Request-Timestamp header on the HTTP request, and the body of the request. Concatenate the version number, the timestamp, and the body of the request to form a basestring. Use a colon as the delimiter between the three elements. For example, v0:123456789:command=/weather&text=94070. The version number right now is always v0. With the help of HMAC SHA256 implemented in your favorite programming language, hash the above basestring, using the Slack Signing Secret as the key. Compare this computed signature to the X-Slack-Signature header on the request. We can also check the timestamp to ensure that it is not a replay attack of a message from long ago. Ok, let's implement this in our project. First, we somehow need to access the raw body of the request, before it has been parsed by body-parser . This is to ensure that the signing hash we calculate is using the same data that Slack did. After parsing, there could be extra characters and formatting etc. Luckily, the body parser package has a verify option , which passes a binary buffer of the raw body request to a user defined function. Let's make a function that conforms to the specs given by body-parser . Add this code to your index.js file: var rawBodySaver = function ( req , res , buf , encoding ) { if ( buf && buf . length ) { req . rawBody = buf . toString ( encoding || 'utf8' ); } } In this function, we grab the bit stream buffer buf , and check that it is not null and that it is not empty (by checking that it has a length). Then we tack it onto the request req as a new property rawBody . We also convert the buffer to a string, using the encoding supplied, or fall back to utf8 as a default. Now that the rawBody is added to the request, it will be available for use by subsequent middleware. We can add it to the body parser by modifying the code where we add the body parser to the app. app . use ( bodyParser . urlencoded ({ verify : rawBodySaver })); In the code above, we added options to our body parser initialisation. We set the verify option to the method we added above. Now, let's make a new middleware function to calculate the signature and compare it. We'll be able to call this middleware before our current code for responding to our Slack slash command. Making it a middleware function will also allow us to easily re-use it on other routes, if we want to add more slash commands, or other commands from Slack in the future. We'll make a new file to hold this code. We'll call it signing.js . In the new file, let's add this code: const crypto = require ( 'crypto' ); function checkSlackMessageSignature ( req , res , next ){ const timestamp = req . headers [ 'x-slack-request-timestamp' ]; const fiveMinutesAgo = Math . floor ( Date . now () / 1000 ) - ( 60 * 5 ); if ( timestamp < fiveMinutesAgo ) { return res . sendFail ( 401 , \"mismatched timestamp\" ); } const signing_secret = process . env . SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET ; const slack_signature = req . headers [ 'x-slack-signature' ]; const [ version , slack_hash ] = slack_signature . split ( '=' ); const sig_basestring = version + ':' + timestamp + ':' + req . rawBody ; const hmac = crypto . createHmac ( 'sha256' , signing_secret ); hmac . update ( sig_basestring ); const our_hash = hmac . digest ( 'hex' ); if ( crypto . timingSafeEqual ( Buffer . from ( slack_hash ), Buffer . from ( our_hash ))) { return next (); } else { return res . send ( 401 , \"Invalid request signature\" ); } } module . exports = checkSlackMessageSignature ; Let's take a look at this code. Firstly, we import the crypto (cryptography) library . We don't need to install this as a package, as it is built into Node.js. This library will allow us to perform the hash of the basestring to compare with the signature. Next, we create a function, with the standard Express middleware parameters : - req , representing the request data. - res , representing an output object that we return results to the user via. - next , representing a function to call if we want to hand control to the next middleware function in the chain. It can also be used to pass an error object back up if something goes wrong processing the request. Then, on the first few lines of the function, we get the timestamp Slack sends from the request headers, and check that it is within the last few minutes. Note the name of the header is all in lowercase, even though Slack specifies that the header is capitalised. This is because Express converts all header keys to lowercase when serving a request. After that, we retrieve the Slack Signing Secret from our environment variables. Let's get our Signing Secret from Slack and add it to the Code Capsules environment now. Head over to your Slack app dashboard, and click on \"Basic Information\" in the left-hand sidebar. Then scroll down to App Credentials , and look for the Signing Secret . Click \"Show\", and copy the secret. Now head over to your Capsule on Code Capsules, and click on the Config tab. Add a new environment variable with Name SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET and paste in the value of the Signing Secret we copied above. Click \"Update & Start Build\" to save the changes. Ok, back to the function. After we retrieve the signing secret from the environment variables, we read out the hash calculated and sent by Slack from the headers using const slack_signature = req.headers['x-slack-signature'] . This will be a string that looks something like v0=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx , where the xxxx represents the actual hash value. We need to split the version identifier v0 from the beginning of the string though, as this is not part of the hash value. We do this in the next line, const [version, slack_hash] = slack_signature.split('=') . Now we have both the version, and the hash string in variables that we can access. After this, we construct our basestring, made from the version we extracted above, the timestamp of the request, and the rawBody (which we extracted in our body parser verify function earlier). The next two lines are where we actually calculate the hash. First, we set up the crypto module with our crypto algorithm type SHA256 , and with our unique Signing Secret. This allows us to then create an HMAC \u2013 or Hash Based Message Authentication code , which is the fancy name for the message signature. We then use the update method on our newly created HMAC to load in our basestring that we constructed above. Now that the crypto HMAC is primed with all the info it needs, we can call the digest function to actually calculate the hash. We pass in as a parameter hex to indicate that we want the result back in hexadecimal format , as this is the same format that Slack sends their calculated hash value in. Great, so now we have Slack's signature hash, and our hash. We need to check that they are the same, which will prove that the message was legitimately sent by Slack. We could just use a normal string compare, i.e. if (slack_hash === our_hash) , but there is a slight security issue with this, known as a timing attack . This type of attack is based on the knowledge that a normal string compare function takes a different amount of time to compare two strings, depending on how close the strings are to each other. An attacker can take advantage of this timing difference to repeatedly send messages and, based on the time for our server to respond, can guess at how close their hash is to what we are expecting. With much patience and many thousands of messages, an attacker could eventually guess our Signing Secret, compromising all our checks. Luckily, there is a simple way to protect from this, and it's built right into the crypto library. This is where we call crypto.timingSafeEqual . This compare always returns in the same amount of time, regardless of how close the hashes are to each other. Therefore, we don't give any extra information away to would-be attackers. Now, if the hashes are equal, from our timingSafeEqual test, we just call return next() which exits our function and passes control to the next middleware function (which will be our slash command handler). If the hashes are not equal, then we know this request is not genuinely from Slack, so we can end early and send a 401 , which is a standard HTTP code for Unauthorized . Basically, we boot the imposter out. Now, the last line in this file is module.exports = checkSlackMessageSignature . This allows our middleware function to be visible to other modules that import this file. Ok, now that we've got this middleware created, let's link it to our slash command handler. Head on back to the index.js file, and import the middleware function by adding this line near the top of the file: const checkSlackMessageSignature = require ( './signing' ); Now, we can navigate to our slack command handler, which started like this: app.post('/slack/command/stats' . Modify that to include a call to the message signature check before the actual handler, like this: app . post ( '/slack/command/stats' , [ checkSlackMessageSignature , function ( req , res ){ Fantastic, now our app is secure. You can commit all the changes, and push it up to Git, which will kick off our final deploy to Code Capsules: git add . git commit -am 'added message signature checking' git push origin Once the code is up and running on Code Capsules, test it out to see that it still responds to the Slack slash command. Then you can try again from Postman or other similar apps, and see that it will not send any info without a valid signature (you can use v0=a2114d57b48eac39b9ad189dd8316235a7b4a8d21a10bd27519666489c69b503 as an example x-slack-signature parameter): Things to Try Next What else can we do? It's almost endless! Add this code to an existing app you have built to get easy info straight from Slack! Add in more slash commands for more info \u2013 for example, you could get current user count on your app, number of database records etc. Basically, any information you could need for dev ops . Look at some of the other functionality Slack offers for integration; for example, using modals , or listening in for keywords in messages .","title":"Slackbot with Node.js"},{"location":"tutorials/build-slackbot-with-node/#build-a-slackbot-with-nodejs-to-monitor-your-applications","text":"Slack is a really useful communication tool when working in teams.

This would not be good for a production system, as sensitive information will be easily found by attackers. So how can we ensure that the request comes from our Slack workspace? Luckily, Slack has thought about this, and sends a message signature with its requests . From the guide in Slack's docs , we can put together some code to check that the request is legitimately from Slack. The main parts of the check, copied from the docs, looks like this: Retrieve the X-Slack-Request-Timestamp header on the HTTP request, and the body of the request. Concatenate the version number, the timestamp, and the body of the request to form a basestring. Use a colon as the delimiter between the three elements. For example, v0:123456789:command=/weather&text=94070. The version number right now is always v0. With the help of HMAC SHA256 implemented in your favorite programming language, hash the above basestring, using the Slack Signing Secret as the key. Compare this computed signature to the X-Slack-Signature header on the request. We can also check the timestamp to ensure that it is not a replay attack of a message from long ago. Ok, let's implement this in our project. First, we somehow need to access the raw body of the request, before it has been parsed by body-parser . This is to ensure that the signing hash we calculate is using the same data that Slack did. After parsing, there could be extra characters and formatting etc. Luckily, the body parser package has a verify option , which passes a binary buffer of the raw body request to a user defined function. Let's make a function that conforms to the specs given by body-parser . Add this code to your index.js file: var rawBodySaver = function ( req , res , buf , encoding ) { if ( buf && buf . length ) { req . rawBody = buf . toString ( encoding || 'utf8' ); } } In this function, we grab the bit stream buffer buf , and check that it is not null and that it is not empty (by checking that it has a length). Then we tack it onto the request req as a new property rawBody . We also convert the buffer to a string, using the encoding supplied, or fall back to utf8 as a default. Now that the rawBody is added to the request, it will be available for use by subsequent middleware. We can add it to the body parser by modifying the code where we add the body parser to the app. app . use ( bodyParser . urlencoded ({ verify : rawBodySaver })); In the code above, we added options to our body parser initialisation. We set the verify option to the method we added above. Now, let's make a new middleware function to calculate the signature and compare it. We'll be able to call this middleware before our current code for responding to our Slack slash command. Making it a middleware function will also allow us to easily re-use it on other routes, if we want to add more slash commands, or other commands from Slack in the future. We'll make a new file to hold this code. We'll call it signing.js . In the new file, let's add this code: const crypto = require ( 'crypto' ); function checkSlackMessageSignature ( req , res , next ){ const timestamp = req . headers [ 'x-slack-request-timestamp' ]; const fiveMinutesAgo = Math . floor ( Date . now () / 1000 ) - ( 60 * 5 ); if ( timestamp < fiveMinutesAgo ) { return res . sendFail ( 401 , \"mismatched timestamp\" ); } const signing_secret = process . env . SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET ; const slack_signature = req . headers [ 'x-slack-signature' ]; const [ version , slack_hash ] = slack_signature . split ( '=' ); const sig_basestring = version + ':' + timestamp + ':' + req . rawBody ; const hmac = crypto . createHmac ( 'sha256' , signing_secret ); hmac . update ( sig_basestring ); const our_hash = hmac . digest ( 'hex' ); if ( crypto . timingSafeEqual ( Buffer . from ( slack_hash ), Buffer . from ( our_hash ))) { return next (); } else { return res . send ( 401 , \"Invalid request signature\" ); } } module . exports = checkSlackMessageSignature ; Let's take a look at this code. Firstly, we import the crypto (cryptography) library . We don't need to install this as a package, as it is built into Node.js. This library will allow us to perform the hash of the basestring to compare with the signature. Next, we create a function, with the standard Express middleware parameters : - req , representing the request data. - res , representing an output object that we return results to the user via. - next , representing a function to call if we want to hand control to the next middleware function in the chain. It can also be used to pass an error object back up if something goes wrong processing the request. Then, on the first few lines of the function, we get the timestamp Slack sends from the request headers, and check that it is within the last few minutes. Note the name of the header is all in lowercase, even though Slack specifies that the header is capitalised. This is because Express converts all header keys to lowercase when serving a request. After that, we retrieve the Slack Signing Secret from our environment variables. Let's get our Signing Secret from Slack and add it to the Code Capsules environment now. Head over to your Slack app dashboard, and click on \"Basic Information\" in the left-hand sidebar. Then scroll down to App Credentials , and look for the Signing Secret . Click \"Show\", and copy the secret. Now head over to your Capsule on Code Capsules, and click on the Config tab. Add a new environment variable with Name SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET and paste in the value of the Signing Secret we copied above. Click \"Update & Start Build\" to save the changes. Ok, back to the function. After we retrieve the signing secret from the environment variables, we read out the hash calculated and sent by Slack from the headers using const slack_signature = req.headers['x-slack-signature'] . This will be a string that looks something like v0=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx , where the xxxx represents the actual hash value. We need to split the version identifier v0 from the beginning of the string though, as this is not part of the hash value. We do this in the next line, const [version, slack_hash] = slack_signature.split('=') . Now we have both the version, and the hash string in variables that we can access. After this, we construct our basestring, made from the version we extracted above, the timestamp of the request, and the rawBody (which we extracted in our body parser verify function earlier). The next two lines are where we actually calculate the hash. First, we set up the crypto module with our crypto algorithm type SHA256 , and with our unique Signing Secret. This allows us to then create an HMAC \u2013 or Hash Based Message Authentication code , which is the fancy name for the message signature. We then use the update method on our newly created HMAC to load in our basestring that we constructed above. Now that the crypto HMAC is primed with all the info it needs, we can call the digest function to actually calculate the hash. We pass in as a parameter hex to indicate that we want the result back in hexadecimal format , as this is the same format that Slack sends their calculated hash value in. Great, so now we have Slack's signature hash, and our hash. We need to check that they are the same, which will prove that the message was legitimately sent by Slack. We could just use a normal string compare, i.e. if (slack_hash === our_hash) , but there is a slight security issue with this, known as a timing attack . This type of attack is based on the knowledge that a normal string compare function takes a different amount of time to compare two strings, depending on how close the strings are to each other. An attacker can take advantage of this timing difference to repeatedly send messages and, based on the time for our server to respond, can guess at how close their hash is to what we are expecting. With much patience and many thousands of messages, an attacker could eventually guess our Signing Secret, compromising all our checks. Luckily, there is a simple way to protect from this, and it's built right into the crypto library. This is where we call crypto.timingSafeEqual . This compare always returns in the same amount of time, regardless of how close the hashes are to each other. Therefore, we don't give any extra information away to would-be attackers. Now, if the hashes are equal, from our timingSafeEqual test, we just call return next() which exits our function and passes control to the next middleware function (which will be our slash command handler). If the hashes are not equal, then we know this request is not genuinely from Slack, so we can end early and send a 401 , which is a standard HTTP code for Unauthorized . Basically, we boot the imposter out. Now, the last line in this file is module.exports = checkSlackMessageSignature . This allows our middleware function to be visible to other modules that import this file. Ok, now that we've got this middleware created, let's link it to our slash command handler. Head on back to the index.js file, and import the middleware function by adding this line near the top of the file: const checkSlackMessageSignature = require ( './signing' ); Now, we can navigate to our slack command handler, which started like this: app.post('/slack/command/stats' . Modify that to include a call to the message signature check before the actual handler, like this: app . post ( '/slack/command/stats' , [ checkSlackMessageSignature , function ( req , res ){ Fantastic, now our app is secure. You can commit all the changes, and push it up to Git, which will kick off our final deploy to Code Capsules: git add . git commit -am 'added message signature checking' git push origin Once the code is up and running on Code Capsules, test it out to see that it still responds to the Slack slash command. Then you can try again from Postman or other similar apps, and see that it will not send any info without a valid signature (you can use v0=a2114d57b48eac39b9ad189dd8316235a7b4a8d21a10bd27519666489c69b503 as an example x-slack-signature parameter):","title":"Adding verification"},{"location":"tutorials/build-slackbot-with-node/#things-to-try-next","text":"What else can we do?

MongoDB Atlas is a database as a service that hosts and manages MongoDBs online. In some ways, this service is similar to Code Capsules. Instead of managing and hosting applications, MongoDB Atlas manages and hosts MongoDBs for you \u2013 leaving you to worry about working with your database. If you have a project idea or a project already hosted on Code Capsules that needs a database, this guide will help you. We'll walk step by step through creating an account with MongoDB Atlas and cover how to connect your application on Code Capsules to MongoDB Atlas. Creating an Account, Organization, and Project with MongoDB Atlas First, create an account with MongoDB Atlas and log in. Your MongoDB Atlas account consists of two organisational tools \u2013 Organizations and Projects : Projects contain all the clusters that host your databases. Organizations contain all of the Projects that you've created. Let's start by creating an organization. Navigate to the \"Organizations\" tab on your dashboard and click \"Create an Organization\". Then: Name your organization. Choose your cloud service. Invite anyone you'd like to your organization, then hit \"Create Organization\". Next up is creating a project: Navigate to the \"Projects\" tab. Click \"New Project\" at the top right of the screen. Choose a name for your project and hit \"Next\". Add any necessary project members, then click \"Create Project\". Next, we'll set up a cluster that'll host your database. Setting up a cluster After creating the project, you'll see a \"Build a Cluster\" button. Click it, and follow the instructions to set up a new cluster. You can choose a paid cluster or a free \"Shared Cluster\". These \"Shared Clusters\" are appropriate for small projects or for learning how to use MongoDB. MongoDB Atlas will begin to create your cluster \u2013 this can take a couple of minutes. While the cluster generates, we can set up some configurations for your database. Access configurations MongoDB Atlas requires you to create a \"user\" in order to access the database in your cluster. You can think of \"users\" as administrator accounts. Navigate to the \"Database Access\" tab under \"Security\". Click \"Add New Database User\". Choose the \"Password\" authentication method and follow the instructions. Make sure to select \"read and write to any database\" under \"Database User Privileges\". Now we need to authorize an IP address to connect to the database. Navigate to the \"Network Access\" tab under \"Security\". You'll see a button \"Add IP Address\". Adding an IP address means only computers on that IP address can connect to the database. Click \"Add IP Address\". We have a couple of options for adding an IP address. If you only want to access the database from your current IP address, hit \"Add Current IP Address\" (note: If you select this option, Code Capsules will not be able to access your database). If you already have an application on Code Capsules, or plan on hosting an application on Code Capsules, select \"Allow Access From Anywhere\". By this time, the cluster hosting your database should be ready. Let's see how we can connect to it. Connecting to the Cluster Under \"Data Storage\" on the dashboard: Click \"Clusters\". Find your cluster. Click \"Connect\". There are multiple ways to connect to the a MongoDB Atlas cluster - we want to connect the database to an application, so, click \"Connect your application\". MongoDB Atlas provides drivers for various programming languages to connect to their databases. Choose your driver and version, and check the \"Include full driver code example\" box to see the code you'll need to connect to your database. Below is their Python driver, with \"Fin\" as the user. In your driver, you'll see something like this: mongodb+srv://YOURUSERNAME:<password>@cluster0.e2fw3.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majorhostity . This is a URI . To connect your application to your database, copy and paste the driver into your code. In your URI, replace <password> and <dbname> with the user's password we created previously . If you plan on hosting your application on Code Capsules, we need to perform one last step. Connecting your Database to Code Capsules Code Capsules connects to your GitHub repository containing your application's code. Therefore, anyone can see your code. This means you should not push your URI to GitHub. If you did, anyone could use your database. To get around this, set up an environment variable in your code for your URI and set the environment variable on Code Capsules. For example, an environment variable in Python program would look like: import os client = pymongo . MongoClient ( os . getenv ( 'DATABASE-URI' )) db = client . test ### Do something here On Code Capsules you would then set an environment variable named DATABASE-URI , containing the URI. To set environment variables on Code Capsules, host your application on Code Capsules and navigate to the \"Config\" tab in your Capsule.

You can find the NodeJS version here . In a previous tutorial , we created and hosted an API on Code Capsules. In this tutorial, we'll create a client for this API in the form of a Telegram bot. This will allow us to pull temperature, weather and exchange rate data on the go by messaging our bot in the Telegram app. We'll also learn how to host this bot on Code Capsules so it can be used by others. Along the way, we'll learn some key concepts about hosting bots securely and efficiently. Let's get started! Requirements To create a Telegram bot, we'll need: Python 3.6+ installed. A GitHub account and Git installed. Virtualenv installed. A Telegram account. A Code Capsules account. An API on Code Capsules, created using the Personal API tutorial . About Telegram Bots Telegram bots appear as contacts on the Telegram interface. Users interact with Telegram bots by messaging them with commands \u2013 these are words preceded by a forward slash, e.g. /weather , or /currency . Commands sent to the bot's account on Telegram will be passed to the bot's backend code (in our case, this will be the code we host on Code Capsules). For example, when we send the command /weather to our bot later in this article, the bot will reply with the weather data from our personal API. Let's create a Telegram bot. Registering a Bot Account and Talking to the BotFather To create a Telegram bot, we need to download Telegram and create a user account. You can use Telegram from either your PC or your phone, or both. Once you have a Telegram account, you can register a new bot by sending a message to BotFather, a bot managed by Telegram themselves. Search for \"BotFather\" and initiate a chat. From the chat interface, follow these steps: Press \"start\". Type /newbot . Choose a name for your bot. Choose a username for your bot (must end in \"bot\"). Once you've chosen a username, the BotFather will reply with an authorisation token . This is a string that enables your bot to send requests to the Telegram Bot API, similar to the authorisation tokens we used to retrieve weather and exchange rate data in the personal API tutorial. Make sure to save this token somewhere safe and private. To see if your bot was successfully created, search for the bot's username. You should see the bot and be able to start a conversation with it. Right now, our bot won't reply to anything you send it, as it doesnt have any backend code yet. Let's change that. Planning and Setup We're going to implement two commands for our bot. When we send the command /weather , our bot will reply with the weather data from the API we created. When we send the command /currency , our bot will reply with the exchange rates from USD to CAD, EUR, and ZAR. Creating a virtual environment and installing requirements First, we need to create a local directory. Give it the same name as our bot. Then, from this directory, open a terminal and create a Python virtual environment by entering the following command: virtualenv env Enter the virtual environment using the appropriate command for your system: Linux/MacOSX : source env/bin/activate Windows : env\\Scripts\\activate.bat The virtual environment will help manage our dependencies for when we host the bot on Code Capsules. To interact with the Telegram Bot API, we need to install the python-telegram-bot library, a Python wrapper for the Telegram Bot API . We'll also use the Python library requests to retrieve data from the weather and currency exchange rate API. To install these requirements, enter the following in your terminal: pip install python-telegram-bot requests Retrieving Data from the API Now we can start coding. Create a file named bot.py in the same directory where we activated the virtual environment. In this file, enter the following code, replacing YOUR-URL-HERE with the URL pointing to the weather and exchange rate API hosted on Code Capsules. import requests url = 'YOUR-URL-HERE/GET' data = requests . get ( url ) # requests data from API data = data . json () # converts return data to json # Retrieve values from API curr_temp = data [ 'curr_temp' ] cad_rate = data [ 'usd_rates' ][ 'CAD' ] eur_rate = data [ 'usd_rates' ][ 'EUR' ] zar_rate = data [ 'usd_rates' ][ 'ZAR' ] def return_weather (): print ( 'Hello. The current temperature in Cape Town is: ' + str ( curr_temp ) + \" celsius.\" ) def return_rates (): print ( \"Hello. Today, USD conversion rates are as follows: USD->CAD = \" + str ( cad_rate ) + \", USD->EUR = \" + str ( eur_rate ) + \", USD->ZAR = \" + str ( zar_rate )) return_weather () return_rates () Here we request the currency and weather data from the API and parse the temperature and conversion rates. Then we print out the data using return_weather() and return_rates() . Try it out! Run the program to ensure everything works, then continue. Creating the Bot Now we can get to creating the actual bot. At the top of the bot.py file, add this line: from telegram.ext import Updater , CommandHandler From the python-telegram-bot library, we import two classes: Updater and CommandHandler . We'll talk about these classes soon. We don't need to print our data anymore \u2013 instead, we'll return a string to our bot, so the bot can display it on Telegram. Replace def return_weather() and def return_rates() with the following: def return_weather (): return 'Hello. The current temperature in Cape Town is: ' + str ( curr_temp ) + \" celsius.\" def return_rates (): return \"Hello. Today, USD conversion rates are as follows: USD->CAD = \" + str ( cad_rate ) + \", USD->EUR = \" + str ( eur_rate ) + \", USD->ZAR = \" + str ( zar_rate ) Now, replace the return_weather() and return_rates() function calls with the code below: def main (): TOKEN = \"YOUR-BOT-TOKEN-HERE\" updater = Updater ( token = TOKEN , use_context = True ) dispatcher = updater . dispatcher weather_handler = CommandHandler ( \"weather\" , weather ) currency_handler = CommandHandler ( \"currency\" , currency ) start_handler = CommandHandler ( \"start\" , start ) dispatcher . add_handler ( weather_handler ) dispatcher . add_handler ( currency_handler ) dispatcher . add_handler ( start_handler ) updater . start_polling () if __name__ == '__main__' : main () At the top of our new main method, which will be called when this file is run, we instantiate updater , an instance of the Telegram library's Updater class. This object will retrieve commands sent to our bot and pass them to an instance of the Dispatcher class. We've assigned this Dispatcher instance to the variable dispatcher for further use. Next, we create three different CommandHandler classes, one for each command that can be sent to our bot: /start , /weather and /currency . We pass two arguments into each instantiation: the command text (without the preceding / ), and a function to call. For example, when a user enters the command /weather , the weather() function will be called. Let's define that function, and the other two. Just above def main() , enter the following three function definitions. def weather ( update , context ): context . bot . send_message ( chat_id = update . effective_chat . id , text = return_weather ()) def currency ( update , context ): context . bot . send_message ( chat_id = update . effective_chat . id , text = return_rates ()) def start ( update , context ): context . bot . send_message ( chat_id = update . effective_chat . id , text = \"Hi! I respond to /weather and /currency. Try them!\" ) Each of these functions calls the python-telegram-bot function send_message() with the ID of the current chat and the appropriate text, either returned from one of our other functions or specified as a string. The update and context arguments are supplied automatically by the dispatcher. Back in our main() function, we use dispatch.add_handler to add all three handlers to our dispatcher. Finally, updater.start_polling() will begin polling for updates from Telegram. This means our code will regularly ask Telegram's servers if any commands have been sent to it. Upon receiving commands, the appropriate handler will be invoked. In the next section , we'll discuss the pitfalls of polling and consider an alternative. The code bot.py file should now look like the code below. Once again, make sure to replace YOUR-URL-HERE with the URL of the API you created in the API tutorial. from telegram.ext import Updater , CommandHandler import requests url = 'YOUR-URL-HERE/GET' data = requests . get ( url ) # requests data from API data = data . json () # converts return data to json # Retrieve values from API curr_temp = data [ 'curr_temp' ] cad_rate = data [ 'usd_rates' ][ 'CAD' ] eur_rate = data [ 'usd_rates' ][ 'EUR' ] zar_rate = data [ 'usd_rates' ][ 'ZAR' ] def return_weather (): return 'Hello. The current temperature in Cape Town is: ' + str ( curr_temp ) + \" celsius.\" def return_rates (): return \"Hello. Today, USD conversion rates are as follows: USD->CAD = \" + str ( cad_rate ) + \", USD->EUR = \" + str ( eur_rate ) + \", USD->ZAR = \" + str ( zar_rate ) def weather ( update , context ): context . bot . send_message ( chat_id = update . effective_chat . id , text = return_weather ()) def currency ( update , context ): context . bot . send_message ( chat_id = update . effective_chat . id , text = return_rates ()) def start ( update , context ): context . bot . send_message ( chat_id = update . effective_chat . id , text = 'Hi! I respond to /weather and /currency. Try these!' ) def main (): TOKEN = \"YOUR-BOT-TOKEN-HERE\" updater = Updater ( token = TOKEN , use_context = True ) dispatcher = updater . dispatcher weather_handler = CommandHandler ( 'weather' , weather ) currency_handler = CommandHandler ( 'currency' , currency ) start_handler = CommandHandler ( 'start' , start ) dispatcher . add_handler ( weather_handler ) dispatcher . add_handler ( currency_handler ) dispatcher . add_handler ( start_handler ) updater . start_polling () if __name__ == '__main__' : main () Below is a conversation with a bot created using this program. Run bot.py and try it out yourself. We won't be able to send messages to our bot if this program isn't running, so hosting it on Code Capsules will allow us to interact with the bot without having to keep this code permanently running on our development PC. While we could deploy our bot to Code Capsules in its current state, there is a downside to our current implementation that we should remedy first. Polling versus Webhooks There are two ways for our bot.py file to receive commands sent to it on Telegram. Currently, the code polls Telegram constantly, regardless of whether the bot is in use. If we hosted this current version on Code Capsules, we would be wasting bandwidth, as the vast majority of polls would return nothing. Instead of polling Telegram for changes, we can create a webhook . This will allow us to receive commands as they are sent by Telegram users, without having to continuously ask Telegram servers for them. We'll set up a webhook by telling Telegram to send commands sent to our bot account to our bot's Code Capsules URL. Our dispatcher will then process the command using the appropriate handler and send back the requested information. Creating a webhook To set up the webhook, replace the line updater.start_polling() in the main function with the code below: PORT = int ( os . environ . get ( 'PORT' , '443' )) HOOK_URL = 'YOUR-CODECAPSULES-URL-HERE' + '/' + TOKEN updater . start_webhook ( listen = '0.0.0.0' , port = PORT , url_path = TOKEN , webhook_url = HOOK_URL ) updater . idle () Here we start a webhook that will listen on our Code Capsules URL at TCP port 443 and with the path of our token. Thus, Telegram will relay commands sent to our bot to the following URL: https://YOUR-CODECAPSULES-SUBDOMAIN.codecapsules.io:443/TOKEN If you've completed some of our other backend tutorials, you will be familiar with setting up web servers that receive GET and POST requests to different routes. You can think of a webhook as a very simple HTTP server that is intended to be used by bots and automated services rather than humans. Preparing For Deployment Before we push our code to GitHub and deploy it on Code Capsules, we need to make one small code change and create some files. Creating an API key environment variable Because we'll push our code to GitHub, we need to hide our bot's authentication key. If we don't, anyone could use our authentication key and take control of our bot. Replace this line TOKEN = \"YOUR-BOT-TOKEN-HERE\" with the below import os TOKEN = os . getenv ( 'BOTAPIKEY' ) os.getenv('BOTAPIKEY') will look for an environment variable with the name \"BOTAPIKEY\". When we host our bot on Code Capsules, we'll set this environment variable to the key we received from the BotFather. With that done, we must now create some files before we can push our code to GitHub and deploy it on Code Capsules. Creating a Procfile and requirements.txt Code Capsules requires a couple of files to deploy our application: Procfile and requirements.txt . The first one tells Code Capsules how to run our application, and the second one tells it which libraries it needs to install. To create the Procfile : Navigate to the directory containing the bot.py file and enter the virtual environment. Create a file named Procfile (with no file extension). Open Procfile , enter web: python3 bot.py , and save the file. In the same directory, open a terminal and activate the virtual environment. Then enter pip3 freeze > requirements.txt to generate a list of requirements for our Code Capsules server. Now we can push our code to GitHub. Create a GitHub repository and send the requirements.txt , Procfile , and bot.py files to the repository. Deploying the Bot to Code Capsules With all of the files sent to GitHub, let's deploy the bot to Code Capsules: Log in to Code Capsules and create a Team and Space as necessary. Link Code Capsules to the GitHub repository created previously . Enter your Code Capsules Space. Create a new Capsule, selecting the \"Backend\" capsule type. Select the GitHub repository containing the bot \u2013 leave \"Repo subpath\" empty and click \"Next\". Leave the \"Run Command\" blank and click \"Create Capsule\". We haven't supplied our webhook a URL yet, and we still need to create an environment variable for our bot's authorisation token. To create an environment variable: Navigate to your Capsule. Click the \"Config\" tab. Add an environment variable with the name \"BOTAPIKEY\" and give it your bot's API key as a value. Make sure to hit the \"Update Capsule\" button after adding the variable. Next, let's supply our webhook with the correct domain. Navigate to the \"Overview\" tab. Copy the domain found under \"Domains\". Open the bot.py file and find the line HOOK_URL = 'YOUR-CODECAPSULES-URL-HERE' + '/' + TOKEN . Replace \"YOUR-CODECAPSULES_URL\" with the domain just copied. Commit and push these changes to GitHub. After pushing these changes, the Capsule will rebuild. Once this is done, the bot is ready. Give it a try!

Search for \"BotFather\" and initiate a chat. From the chat interface, follow these steps: Press \"start\". Type /newbot . Choose a name for your bot. Choose a username for your bot (must end in \"bot\"). Once you've chosen a username, the BotFather will reply with an authorisation token . This is a string that enables your bot to send requests to the Telegram Bot API, similar to the authorisation tokens we used to retrieve weather and exchange rate data in the personal API tutorial. Make sure to save this token somewhere safe and private. To see if your bot was successfully created, search for the bot's username.

At the top of the bot.py file, add this line: from telegram.ext import Updater , CommandHandler From the python-telegram-bot library, we import two classes: Updater and CommandHandler . We'll talk about these classes soon. We don't need to print our data anymore \u2013 instead, we'll return a string to our bot, so the bot can display it on Telegram. Replace def return_weather() and def return_rates() with the following: def return_weather (): return 'Hello.

This object will retrieve commands sent to our bot and pass them to an instance of the Dispatcher class. We've assigned this Dispatcher instance to the variable dispatcher for further use. Next, we create three different CommandHandler classes, one for each command that can be sent to our bot: /start , /weather and /currency . We pass two arguments into each instantiation: the command text (without the preceding / ), and a function to call. For example, when a user enters the command /weather , the weather() function will be called. Let's define that function, and the other two. Just above def main() , enter the following three function definitions. def weather ( update , context ): context . bot . send_message ( chat_id = update . effective_chat . id , text = return_weather ()) def currency ( update , context ): context . bot . send_message ( chat_id = update . effective_chat . id , text = return_rates ()) def start ( update , context ): context . bot . send_message ( chat_id = update . effective_chat . id , text = \"Hi! I respond to /weather and /currency. Try them!\" ) Each of these functions calls the python-telegram-bot function send_message() with the ID of the current chat and the appropriate text, either returned from one of our other functions or specified as a string. The update and context arguments are supplied automatically by the dispatcher. Back in our main() function, we use dispatch.add_handler to add all three handlers to our dispatcher. Finally, updater.start_polling() will begin polling for updates from Telegram. This means our code will regularly ask Telegram's servers if any commands have been sent to it. Upon receiving commands, the appropriate handler will be invoked. In the next section , we'll discuss the pitfalls of polling and consider an alternative. The code bot.py file should now look like the code below. Once again, make sure to replace YOUR-URL-HERE with the URL of the API you created in the API tutorial. from telegram.ext import Updater , CommandHandler import requests url = 'YOUR-URL-HERE/GET' data = requests . get ( url ) # requests data from API data = data . json () # converts return data to json # Retrieve values from API curr_temp = data [ 'curr_temp' ] cad_rate = data [ 'usd_rates' ][ 'CAD' ] eur_rate = data [ 'usd_rates' ][ 'EUR' ] zar_rate = data [ 'usd_rates' ][ 'ZAR' ] def return_weather (): return 'Hello.

In this tutorial, we'll extend a boilerplate Express application on Code Capsules to create a Telegram bot in Node.js that tracks and responds with current Ethereum prices. Getting Started Navigate to the Express.js deployment guide and follow the instructions outlined there to deploy the boilerplate application. You will need to clone the forked repository to your local development environment to extend the functionality of the boilerplate application and make a Telegram bot. We need to install the node_modules for the boilerplate application before we can run it locally. Navigate to the project's root folder in a terminal or command prompt window and run npm install there. Now you can run npm start in the project's root folder to see how the application looks. Register a Bot Account You'll need a Telegram user account before you can create a Telegram bot. Head over to Telegram and create an account if you don't already have one. When you've signed in to Telegram, search for \"BotFather\" (a bot for managing all other Telegram bots) and start a new chat with it. Follow the steps below to register a new bot with the BotFather: Type /start and press send. Type /newbot and press send. Choose a name for your bot. Choose a username for your bot that ends in bot . The BotFather will respond with a message containing an access token for your newly created bot. This access token will allow our application to access the Telegram API and tell our bot what to do when receiving different messages from users. To confirm that your bot was created successfully, search for the bot's username. You should be able to see it and start a conversation with it, although it won't respond as we haven't written the bot's logic yet. Set Up the Development Environment Your bot's access token is sensitive data and shouldn't be written in the code because anyone with access to your token can control your bot, so it's important to store it where it's safe and secure. The solution is to use environment variables to reference sensitive information in code. Create a .env file in the project's root folder and add the line below to it, replacing <YOUR_BOT_TOKEN> with the actual access token you were issued with by the BotFather: BOT_TOKEN=<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN> Add .env to the .gitignore file on a new line so that the .env file won't be uploaded to your remote repository when you push your changes. Install Required Packages Next, install the package for loading environment variables by running the command below from a terminal window in the project's root folder: npm install dotenv Also install the axios and telegraf packages by running the commands listed below from a terminal window in the project's root folder: npm install axios npm install telegraf Create the Bot Logic Open index.js in the root folder and modify its contents with the code below: const express = require ( 'express' ) const expressApp = express () const axios = require ( \"axios\" ); const path = require ( \"path\" ) const port = process . env . PORT || 3000 ; expressApp . use ( express . static ( 'static' )) expressApp . use ( express . json ()); require ( 'dotenv' ). config (); const { Telegraf } = require ( 'telegraf' ); const bot = new Telegraf ( process . env . BOT_TOKEN ); expressApp . get ( \"/\" , ( req , res ) => { res . sendFile ( path . join ( __dirname + '/index.html' )); }); bot . launch () The code snippet above instantiates express , axios and telegraf objects, which we'll need to create the telegram bot. Notice how we use environment variables to reference our bot's access token in this line: const bot = new Telegraf(process.env.BOT_TOKEN); . Using the bot.launch() command isn't efficient from a bandwidth perspective, as our bot continously polls the Telegram API to check if it has received any new messages. Later in the tutorial, we will look at how to use webhooks in order to be more conservative with the bandwidth our bot uses. Add Bot Commands Now it's time to add the logic for the commands which tell our bot how to respond to different messages. Add the code below to index.js just above the bot.launch() line: bot . command ( 'start' , ctx => { console . log ( ctx . from ) bot . telegram . sendMessage ( ctx . chat . id , 'Hello there! Welcome to the Code Capsules telegram bot.\\nI respond to /ethereum. Please try it' , { }) }) bot . command ( 'ethereum' , ctx => { var rate ; console . log ( ctx . from ) axios . get ( `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=ethereum&vs_currencies=usd` ) . then ( response => { console . log ( response . data ) rate = response . data . ethereum const message = `Hello, today the ethereum price is ${ rate . usd } USD` bot . telegram . sendMessage ( ctx . chat . id , message , { }) }) }) The first command is a startup message, which is triggered when a user sends a /start message to the bot. The startup message contains a greeting that tells the user which other commands the bot can respond to, in this case, the /ethereum command. When a user sends an /ethereum message, the bot first checks for the latest price of ethereum at CoinGecko then send it to the user. Run Bot Locally Now that our bot can respond to users if they send it /start or /ethereum messages, run npm start in a terminal window while in the project's root folder to test this functionality. Send your bot /start and /ethereum messages in Telegram, and it should respond with the correct messages. Polling vs Webhooks Earlier on, we mentioned that the bot.launch() command uses polling, which isn't the best practice when deploying any application to production. Using webhooks is a good alternative to polling, as it ensures our bot receives commands as they are sent by Telegram users, as opposed to constantly polling or asking the Telegram API for them. Add the code below to the index.js file to add a webhook to our bot and comment out the bot.launch() line: expressApp . use ( bot . webhookCallback ( '/secret-path' )) bot . telegram . setWebhook ( '<YOUR_CAPSULE_URL>/secret-path' ) . . . // bot.launch() expressApp . listen ( port , () => console . log ( `Listening on ${ port } ` )); Navigate to the capsule you deployed at the start of this tutorial and copy its domain from the \"Overview\" tab. In the code snippet above replace <YOUR_CAPSULE_URL> with the domain you just copied. Deploying the Bot On Code Capsules, navigate to the \"Configure\" tab of your capsule and add a BOT_TOKEN environment variable giving it the value of your bot's access token. Now head over to your local development environment and commit your changes if you haven't already. Run git push in a terminal window while in the project's root folder to deploy your bot to production!","title":"Node.js Telegram Bot"},{"location":"tutorials/create-nodejs-telegram-bot/#create-and-host-a-telegram-bot-with-nodejs-on-code-capsules","text":"Social media bots allow you to automate responses and reactions to posts or messages sent to the bot.

Imagine: you navigate to some website and see your location's temperature displayed on their homepage. How did they present this information? Without a doubt, they used an API. APIs are hosted on a server and operate as an access point between the user and some data. Part of this guide takes a look at the weatherstack API \u2013 an API providing weather data. For the website to retrieve your location's temperature, they would've sent a request to an API like weatherstack. In the request, they would include information about your computer's location. weatherstack's API would then return weather data related to your locale, such as the temperature and cloud cover. The weather website will then display this data on their homepage for you to view. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to create a personal API with Python (using Flask ). Our API will use data from the weatherstack and OpenExchangeRates APIs to give us up-to-the-minute USD exchange rates and the temperature of a given city. We'll host our API on Code Capsules so that anyone will be able to request information from it, no matter their location. Prerequisites Before starting, we'll need a GitHub account and knowledge of how to push code from a local repository to a remote repository . Also ensure you've installed the following: Git Python 3.XX+ Virtualenv Setting Up Our Environment First, let's set up a virtual Python environment using Virtualenv. Virtualenv provides a clean Python install with no third-party libraries or packages, allowing us to work on this project without interfering with the dependencies of our other projects. Open your terminal and create an empty folder. Navigate to the folder via your terminal, and enter: virtualenv env To activate the virtual environment, enter one of the following: Linux/MacOSX source env/bin/activate Windows \\env\\Scripts\\activate.bat If the virtual environment has activated correctly, you'll see (env) to the left of your name in the terminal. Installing the Dependencies Now that we've activated the virtual environment, let's take a look at the packages we'll use to create our API: Flask is a minimal web development framework for Python. Flask provides resources and tools for building and maintaining web applications, websites, and more. Gunicorn is a WSGI server that will help serve our Python application (the API hosted on Code Capsules). Requests is a Python library we will use to interact with APIs. From your terminal where you activated the virtual environment, install these packages with: pip3 install flask gunicorn requests Note pip will have automatically been installed when you set the virtual environment if not you can follow this guide to install it. Registering Accounts on OpenExchangeRates and weatherstack Our API will return the current temperature of a chosen city and the USD exchange rates for three currencies. We'll create our API by combining data from two other APIs \u2013 weatherstack and OpenExchangeRates . As their names suggest, weatherstack will provide the temperature data, and OpenExchangeRates the exchange rate data. Registering an account is required so that we can receive a unique API key . An API key is a password that lets us use a particular API. In APIs with more sensitive data, these are used to prevent unauthorised access, but for open APIs like weatherstack and OpenExchangeRates, they're used for rate limiting to prevent users from sending too many requests at once and overwhelming the system. Creating our accounts First, let's register an account on OpenExchangeRates. Navigate to here and: Sign up and log in. On the dashboard, click \"App IDs\". Take note of your \"App ID\" (API key) you will need to paste it into the code below. Obtaining the weatherstack API key is similar: Create a free account on weatherstack Log in and take note of the API key presented in the control panel, you will need to paste it into the code below. Now we can retrieve data from the OpenExchangeRates and weatherstack APIs using our API keys. Let's try that out now. Getting exchange rates First, let's see how requesting data from OpenExchangeRates works. Create a file named app.py and open it. To request data from an API, we need an endpoint for the type of data we want. APIs often provide multiple endpoints for different information \u2013 for example, a weather API may have one endpoint for temperature and another for humidity. In the code below, the EXCHANGE_URL variable contains the OpenExchangeRates endpoint for retrieving the latest exchange rates. Enter it in your app.py file now, replacing YOUR-API-KEY-HERE with the OpenExchangeRates API key you saved earlier. import requests EXCHANGE_URL = 'https://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json?app_id=YOUR-API-KEY-HERE' exchange_data = requests . get ( EXCHANGE_URL ) Note that we are including a secret API key in our codebase, which is bad practice. In later tutorials, you'll see how to use environment variables with Code Capsules for better security. In this code, we're using the requests module to fetch data from the API. It does this over HTTPS, the same way your browser would. In fact, if you copy the value of EXCHANGE_URL to your browser now, you'll see exactly what data your code is fetching. Note the format of the URL: https://openexchangerates.org is the website. /api/ is the path containing the API portion of the website. latest.json is the API endpoint which returns the latest exchange rates. ?app_id=YOUR-API-KEY-HERE specifies our password for accessing the API. OpenExchangeRates has many other endpoints, each of which provides a different set of data. For example, you could request data from the historical endpoint ( https://openexchangerates.org/api/historical/ ) to access past exchange rates. Now let's print the data using the .json() method. This method converts the data from raw text into in JSON (Javascript Object Notation), which we can work with like a Python dictionary. print ( exchange_data . json ()) When running the program, you will see a lot of output. This is because we are currently retrieving every exchange rate OpenExchangeRates provides. Let's modify the code to only receive exchange rates from USD to EUR, CAD, and ZAR. Add the following lines below EXCHANGE_URL : EXCHANGE_PARAMS = { 'symbols' : 'ZAR,EUR,CAD' } exchange_data = requests . get ( EXCHANGE_URL , EXCHANGE_PARAMS ) Then change your print statement as follows: print(exchange_data.json()['rates']) # Print only exchange rates Now we've included an EXCHANGE_PARAMS variable. Providing parameters to an API endpoint will alter which data is retrieved. The parameters available will depend on the API endpoint. You can find a list of parameters for the latest endpoint here . In our case, we supplied the parameter symbols with the three currencies we want data for. When you run the program again, you should only see three exchange rates. Getting the temperature Now that we've obtained the exchange rates, we can retrieve the temperature for a city. Let's modify the program by adding the following below the print statement. Make sure to replace YOUR-API-KEY-HERE with the weatherstack API key. WEATHER_URL = 'http://api.weatherstack.com/current?access_key=YOUR-API-KEY-HERE' WEATHER_PARAMS = { 'query' : 'Cape Town' } weather = requests . get ( WEATHER_URL , params = WEATHER_PARAMS ) print ( weather . json ()[ 'current' ][ 'temperature' ]) # will print only the temperature; print without indexing to see all the values returned! Here we retrieve the temperature for Cape Town, South Africa. You can replace \"Cape Town\" with another city of your choice to see its temperature. Creating our API Now we'll get to creating the API with Flask. Our API will package the weatherstack and OpenExchangeRates data together in a single endpoint. This means we can build other applications later which will be able to retrieve all of the data above by calling requests.get(MY_CODE_CAPSULES_URL) . Beginning steps with Flask First, we can remove all the print statements in our app.py file. Afterwards, edit the file accordingly: import requests from flask import Flask , jsonify EXCHANGE_URL = 'https://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json?app_id=YOUR-API-KEY-HERE' EXCHANGE_PARAMS = { 'symbols' : 'ZAR,EUR,CAD' } WEATHER_URL = 'http://api.weatherstack.com/current?access_key=YOUR-API-KEY-HERE' WEATHER_PARAMS = { 'query' : 'Cape Town' } app = Flask ( __name__ ) @app . route ( '/' ) # Create main page of web-application def index (): return \"Welcome to my API!\" # Display text on main page if __name__ == '__main__' : app . run () # Run the application After instantiating a Flask object, we add @app.route('/') . The @ symbol is known as a Python decorator \u2013 their use isn't very important for our application. Just understand that the below creates the homepage for your API: @app . route ( ` / ` ) def index (): return \"Welcome to my API!\" Once the API is hosted on Code Capsules, you'll see \"Welcome to my API!\" when you visit the app's URL which you can find under the domains section of the capsule. Next, we'll implement the ability to \"get\" (using requests.get() ) our data from the API when it's hosted. Combining the APIs We've already written code to retrieve our data \u2013 now we just need to combine it and create an endpoint to fetch it. We'll do this by creating a new endpoint called /get that returns our selected data. @app . route ( '/get' , methods = [ 'GET' ]) # Add an endpoint to access our API def get (): exchange_data = requests . get ( EXCHANGE_URL , EXCHANGE_PARAMS ) weather = requests . get ( WEATHER_URL , params = WEATHER_PARAMS ) return jsonify ({ 'usd_rates' : exchange_data . json ()[ 'rates' ], 'curr_temp' : weather . json ()[ 'current' ][ 'temperature' ] }) @app.route('/get', methods=['GET']) adds an endpoint, /get , allowing us to retrieve data from the API. When Code Capsules gives us a URL for our API, we'll be able to use this URL plus the endpoint /get to retrieve data from our API, combining the inputs from the two APIs we are calling out to in turn. Next, the statement below returns our data in JSON: return jsonify ({ 'usd_rates' : exchange_data . json ()[ 'rates' ], 'curr_temp' : weather . json ()[ 'current' ][ 'temperature' ] }) Here, the exchange rate data is stored under 'usd_rates' and the temperature data under curr_temp . This means that if we request our data and store it in a variable like my_data , we'll be able to print out the exchange rates by executing print(my_data['usd_rates']) , and print the temperature by executing print(my_data['curr_temp']) . The API is complete \u2013 only a few steps left before hosting it on Code Capsules. Freezing Requirements and Creating the Procfile Before sending our API to GitHub (so Code Capsules can host it), we need the requirements.txt file, and a Procfile. The requirements.txt file contains information about the libraries we've used to make our API, which will allow Code Capsules to install those same libraries when we deploy it. To create this file, first ensure your terminal is still in the virtual environment. Then, in the same directory as the app.py file, enter pip3 freeze > requirements.txt in your terminal. Next, create a new file named Procfile in the same directory. Open the Procfile and enter: web: gunicorn app:app This tells Code Capsules to use the Gunicorn WSGI server to serve the HTTP data sent and received by our Flask API. Hosting the API on Code Capsules The API is now ready to host on Code Capsules. Follow these steps to get it online: Create a remote repository on GitHub. Push the Procfile , requirements.txt , and app.py files to the repository. Link the repository to your Code Capsules account following this guide. Create a new Team and Space (as necessary). With the repository linked to Code Capsules, we just need to store the API on a Capsule: Create a new Capsule. Choose Backend Capsule and continue. Select your product type and GitHub repository, click next. Leave the \"Run Command\" field blank (our Procfile handles this step). Create the Capsule. Once the Capsule has built, the API is hosted! Let's take a quick look at how to interact with it. Viewing and interacting with our API Once the Capsule has been built, Code Capsules will provide you with a URL (found in the \"Overview\" tab). Enter the URL in your browser, and you'll be greeted with \"Welcome to my API!\". To view the API data, add /get to the end of the URL. Depending on your browser (Google Chrome was used below), you'll see something like this: Now try interacting with the API through code. In a new file, enter the following, replacing the URL with your Code Capsules URL (ensure /get is at the end of the URL): import requests MY_URL = 'https://my-code-capsules-url.codecapsules.space/get' api_data = requests . get ( MY_URL ) print ( api_data . json ()) All done!

Why Custom Domains and How Do They Work? Custom domains garner name recognition for your web-application or website. Consider the Google search-engine: without a domain, you would need to type in the IP address for it. This would be far more difficult to remember than the URL www.google.com \u2013 instantly recognizable. Web-addresses like www.google.com act as placeholders for an IP address and help us remember the website. When you type a URL in your search bar, your computer sends a request with the URL to the Domain Name System (DNS) \u2013 a cluster of servers worldwide containing domain names and corresponding IP addresses. The DNS then returns the URL's corresponding IP address, and you connect to the website you were trying to reach. Following this guide, we'll learn how to buy a domain and route it to a Code Capsules hosted web-application. Along the way, we'll learn more about the DNS and related topics. Prerequisites To complete this tutorial, we'll need: A web-application hosted on Code Capsules . A valid payment method (credit card, PayPal, cryptocurrency, bank transfer) to purchase a custom domain. Where to Buy a Domain Domain Registrars are businesses accredited to sell domains. We'll purchase a domain from the registrar www.gandi.net. Some things to keep in mind when choosing a domain name: Domains that don't contain highly sought after words are usually inexpensive. You can save on domains by using less popular Top-level domains (TLD's) \u2013 for example: rather than register a \".com\" website, register a \".info\" website. Keeping these tips in mind, let's purchase a domain. Purchasing a domain from Gandi To purchase a domain on Gandi: Navigate to www.gandi.net. Enter the domain you want in the domain search box (ex: https://www.lincolnsportfolio.co.za) Add the domain to the shopping cart. Checkout by clicking the shopping cart at the top right of the screen. Decide how many years you'd like to host the domain, and press the Checkout button. Follow the prompts to create an account and purchase your domain. Then log in to Gandi.net with your new account and click the \"Domain\" button on the dashboard. If Gandi has processed the domain, find it under the \"Active\" tab \u2013 if it's still processing, view it under the \"Pending\" tab. Processing a domain can take some time. Before routing the new domain to a web application, we have something left to consider \u2013 the security of your web-application. HTTP vs. HTTPS Domain names are one portion of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) \u2013 Google's domain name is google.com , and the URL is http://www.google.com. Similarly, example.com is a domain name, and http://www.example.com is the URL associated with it. HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol . When you see HTTP beginning a URL such as http://www.google.com, you know that the information retrieved by entering this address returns in clear text . This means data is vulnerable when interacting with this website, presenting a problem for any website dealing with sensitive information. The alternative is HTTPS \u2013 Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure . HTTPS encrypts data sent between you and the server that you're connected to. Because of the security risks associated with HTTP , many websites \"force\" an HTTPS connection. Try entering http://www.google.com in your web browser. You'll notice the http portion automatically becomes https . Like the Google example, we'll make sure that if a user attempts to connect via http://www.yourwebsitehere.com , they'll redirect to https:/www.yourwebitehere.com . Setting up HTTPS is a quick process with Gandi \u2013 let's do that for your domain. Setting Up HTTPS for Your Domain To set up HTTPS with the domain, we need to register a free SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate. In short, an SSL certificate helps encrypt the data sent when connected via HTTPS. To register an SSL certificate for our domain we must: Click on the domain under the active tab. Navigate to the Web Forwarding tab. Click Create at the top right. From the Address drop-down menu , choose \"HTTP:// + HTTPS://\" Type \"www\" in the textbox to the right. From the Address to forward to drop-down menu, choose \"HTTPS://\" Type in the name of the domain. Choose \"Permanent\" under Type of web forwarding The above image shows an example form \u2013 click create when done. Repeat this process, but choose \"http://\" in the Address drop-down and type \"*\" in the textbox next to it. This will forward any users connect to http://www.yourdomainhere.tld or http://yourdomainhere.tld to https://yourdomainhere.tld \u2013 it forces users to take advantage of HTTPS. After creating this forwarding address, Gandi automatically creates an SSL certificate. This can take some time to process. You'll need to verify your email address with Gandi before receiving the SSL certificate, so check your email for a verification link from Gandi. Now that the domain has an SSL certificate, we'll route your Code Capsules web-application to the domain. Navigate to your domain on the Gandi dashboard. Routing Your Web-application to The Domain Click the \"DNS Records\" tab at the top of the page. DNS records contain your domain's \"information\". When users enter your domain in their search bar, their computer will receive these records (or information). Gandi supplies numerous DNS records with default values upon domain creation. We'll only concern ourselves with entries containing the \"A\" and \"CNAME\" types. An A record stores the IP address of the server that hosts your web-application (in this case, Code Capsules). When you type in a domain name, your computer requests the A record associated with the domain from the DNS. The DNS returns the A record containing the IP address \u2013 this is what you finally connect to. Let's modify the default A record to route to your web-application: On Code Capsules , navigate to the Capsule you wish to route to your new domain. Click Overview then Add A Custom Domain . Copy the supplied IP address and type in the name of the web-address purchased. Click Create Domain . At the DNS record tab in domain view on Gandi, edit the entry with \"A\" as the type. Enter \"@\" for its name and paste the Code Capsules supplied IP address in the IPv4 address text box. Click create. It may take up to 3 hours for these changes to process . View your web-application by typing https://yourdomainname.tld , replacing your domain name with \"yourdomainname\" and \".tld\" with your extension (such as .com). Notice that if you type https://www.yourdomainhere.tld , you'll receive a 404 error. To fix this, we'll add a new \"CNAME\" record. A CNAME is like an alias for a domain \u2013 we're going to create one that tells the DNS that it should direct users who enter the leading \"www.\" to the same place as those who leave it out. To allow users to enter in \"www.\" before your domain name: Return to Code Capsules and press the Add A Custom Domain button again. Under domain name, enter www.yourdomainname.tld , replacing your name and TLD appropriately. Return to the DNS record tab on Gandi, and press Add at the top right. Choose the CNAME type. Enter \"www\" in the name text-box. Type your default Code Capsules web-application URL under Hostname (find this in the \"Overview\" tab in your web-application's Capsule), with a period at the end. It should look like the below: Click create. You can now view your web-application by entering either https://yourdomainname.tld or https://www.yourdomainname.tld . Once more, it may take up to 3 hours for these changes to process . What Next? We've learned how to purchase, secure, and configure a domain, route a domain to your Code Capsules application, and even a little bit about DNS. If you're interested, there is still a lot to learn about DNS. A fine place to start is Amazon Web Services' page on DNS .

Users will register an account with the sleep tracker and log in. To track their sleep data, users will enter a date and number of hours slept. We'll present users with a graph showing the sleep data they've logged, so users can get a visual representation of their sleep habits over time. Throughout this tutorial series, we'll use many tools to create an interactive experience. We'll learn how to: Create a user login and register system with Python's Flask . Use a MongoDB NoSQL database to store data. Create interactive Plotly graphs. This tutorial series is best suited for those with some Python, HTML, and Flask experience. But even if you feel you don't have much experience with these, don't worry. We'll walk through this application step-by-step. Let's get started! MongoDB Data Capsule One of the most important aspects of this tutorial is using a Mongo Database (MongoDB). With this MongoDB, we can track users' login information and sleep data. MongoDB is a NoSQL databases, which means we can store data easily, in variable formats, without having to first create tables, as we would have to with a traditional SQL databse. If you're unfamiliar with NoSQL databases or MongoDB in general, take a look at this explainer by the MongoDB organisation. Follow this short tutorial to create a MongoDB data capsule that we'll use to store the user data for this sleep tracker application. This step is extremely important \u2013 without a database, our application will not function. Once you've set up a MongoDB data capsule, continue with this tutorial. Requirements In addition to creating a MongoDB Data Capsule, make sure you have the following: Git installed and a registered GitHub account. Virtualenv installed. A registered Code Capsules account. Project Setup and Introduction Creating this sleep tracker will be a two-part process. First, we will create a login and registration page and a user management backend. Second, we will create a page where users enter their sleep data and view a graph. This tutorial will focus on the first part: dealing with user management. To start, create a sleep-tracker directory somewhere on your computer. All of our project's files will be in this directory. Setting up Virtual Env With our sleep-tracker directory created, we need to set up a virtual environment . Setting up a virtual environment will be useful when we host our web application on Code Capsules. Virtual environments ensure that only the libraries used in the development of our sleep tracker application will be installed by Code Capsule's servers. To create a virtual environment, navigate to the sleep-tracker directory in a terminal and enter virtualenv env . Then, activate the virtual environment with: Linux/MacOSX: source env/bin/activate Windows: \\env\\Scripts\\activate.bat If the virtual environment activated correctly, you'll notice (env) to the left of your name in the terminal. Keep this terminal open \u2013 we'll install the project dependencies next. Installing requirements Our sleep tracker will use the following Python libraries: Flask is a lightweight Python web development framework. Flask-Login provides user session management for Flask. This will help us implement a user login and registeration system without having to create one from scratch. Flask Bcrypt is a hashing extension for Flask. This allow us to store users' passwords securely and without knowing what they are. Gunicorn is the WSGI server we'll use to host our application on Code Capsules. Pymongo is a Python library that has tools for interacting with MongoDBs. We'll use Pymongo to connect and send data to our MongoDB. To install these libraries, activate the virtual environment in your terminal and type the following: pip3 install flask flask-login flask-bcrypt gunicorn pymongo Next, we'll create all the files and directories that we'll use in both parts of this series. Creating the file structure Because we'll use Flask to render our HTML files and serve static content, we need to have a specific project structure. Flask expects to find HTML files in a directory named templates and static content such as CSS stylesheets and images in a directory named static . In the sleep-tracker directory, create both of these directories. Inside templates , create three files: base.html , login.html , and main.html . base.html will contain the skeleton for our website's other HTML pages. login.html will contain the HTML for the main page of our web application. Here, users will log in or register an account with our sleep tracker. main.html will contain the HTML for the page where users will enter their sleep data and view a graph of this data. We'll deal with this file in the second part of this tutorial. Next, open the static directory and create a file named style.css . This will be the only file in this directory, and will conain the CSS style for our website. Finally, in the main sleep-tracker directory, create a file named app.py . In this file, we'll write the Python code that serves our HTML content to user and manages their activities on the web application. Creating the HTML Templates Flask uses the Jinja templating library to allow us to embed Python-like code in HTML. This will allow us to create web pages which change dynamically in response to user actions such as registration, login and entering sleep tracking data. In this section, we will be populating the files we created in templates above, starting with base.html . Base.html The base.html file will contain all of the HTML code common throughout our application. This allows us to use it as a skeleton for every other page and avoid repeating standard markup such as stylesheet links. Open the base.html file and enter the following markup: <!DOCTYPE html> < html > < head > < meta charset = \"utf-8\" > < title > Sleep Tracker </ title > < meta name = \"author\" content = \"your-name-here\" > < meta name = \"description\" content = \"This web-application helps you track your sleep!\" > < link rel = \"stylesheet\" href = \"{{url_for('static',filename='style.css')}}\" > </ head > < body > {% block content %}{% endblock %} </ body > </ html > This is our skeleton. When Flask serves our login.html or main.html pages, it will replace the {% block content %}{% endblock %} with that page's unique content. Any code between {% and %} or {{ and }} is Jinja syntax, which is largely similar to Python code. Flask will evaluate this code before rendering HTML files and serving them to users. In this example, we use Jinja syntax to call Flask's url_for() function. To link our stylesheet, Flask uses the url_for() function to find the style.css file in the static directory. Creating the Login Page Now that we've created the base.html file, we can implement our login.html file. Open login.html and add the following markup: {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block content %} < h2 > Login or register here to track your sleep! </ h2 > < form action = \"\" method = \"POST\" > < ul > < li > < label for = \"username\" > Username: </ label > < input type = \"text\" id = \"name\" name = \"user_name\" > </ li > < li > < label for = \"password\" > Password: </ label > < input type = \"password\" id = \"password\" name = \"user_pw\" > </ li > < li class = \"button\" > < input type = \"submit\" name = 'login' value = 'Login' > < input type = \"submit\" name = 'register' value = 'Register' > </ li > </ ul > </ form > {% endblock %} The line {% extends \"base.html\" %} tells Jinja to render this page by populating each of base.html 's named block directives with the corresponding block content defined in login.html . In this instance, we've only defined a single block named content , but we could define multiple blocks. For example, we might want to have a head block that defines some page-specific content that needs to be in the HTML <head> tag. On this page, we've created a form containing input fields for users to enter their username and password, as well as login and register buttons. Note the POST HTTP method \u2013 this will ensure that the username and password are sent as POST parameters in the HTTP request body, rather than as GET parameters in the URL. This allows us to differentate between when a user visits the login page (a GET request) versus when they click the register or login button. Before we take a look at our work so far, let's populate our style.css file to make our HTML look a bit better. Adding styles Open the style.css file in the static directory and add the following: form { margin : auto ; width : 500 px ; } form li + li { margin-top : 1 em ; } ul { /* Remove unordered list dots */ list-style : none ; padding : .1 ; margin : .1 ; } label { display : inline-block ; width : 100 px ; text-align : right ; } input , textarea { font : \"Times New Roman\" , serif ; /* Change border & width of textarea */ border : 1 px solid #000000 ; width : 300 px ; box-sizing : border-box ; } . button { /* Align w/ text box */ padding-left : 105 px ; } h2 { text-align : center ; font : \"Times New Roman\" , serif ; } Feel free to add your own personal touches, such as a favourite colour or font. Testing what we have Now that we've created our templates and stylesheet, let's add some initial functionality to app.py . Open the file and enter the following code: from flask import Flask , render_template , url_for , request , redirect app = Flask ( __name__ ) ## Login/Register page @app . route ( '/' ) def login (): return render_template ( 'login.html' ) @app . route ( '/main' ) def main (): return render_template ( 'main.html' ) Here we've created two routes : + / , which will be our web application's homepage and serve the content of login.html . + /main , which will be our web application's sleep tracker page and serve the content of main.html . Flask uses the @app.route function decorator to determine which functions will be executed when the user visits different routes. View the application by opening a terminal in the sleep-tracker directory and and entering flask run . After running the application, Flask will provide you with URL. Enter this URL in your web browser, and you'll see the login screen. It should look something like this: Handling User Registration and Login Rather than implementing a user registration and login system ourselves, we'll use the Flask Login library that we installed earlier to provide this functionality. This will help us to save time and avoid common usability and security pitfalls. We will store user information in the database we created at the beginning of this tutorial . First, let's import the functionality we'll need from: + flask-login , flask-bcrypt , to handle users. + pymongo , to interface with MongoDB. + re , to validate user input. Enter the following code below the line that starts with from flask import : from flask_login import LoginManager , UserMixin , login_required , login_user , logout_user , current_user from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt import pymongo , re Now we can create an instance of the LoginManager class and set a secret key for our application. Just below the line that defines app , add: app . config [ 'SECRET_KEY' ] = 'your-secret-key-here' login_manager = LoginManager ( app ) This class does exactly what it says \u2013 manages logged in users and communicates any necessary information about a user to Flask. Replace your-secret-key-here with a long randomly generated string. UUIDs are good for this purpose. You can generate one with the following terminal command: python3 -c 'import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4().hex.upper())' Next, we need to initialise a bcrypt object for our application. Add the following code below the line that defines login_manager : bcrypt = Bcrypt ( app ) When a user registers with our sleep tracker, we'll create a new entry in our MongoDB with the user's username and password. That way, when a user logs in to our sleep tracker, we can see if the information they entered matches the information in our MongoDB. Beneath the last line we added, add the following: client = pymongo . MongoClient ( 'mongodb+srv://YOURUSERNAME:YOURPASSWORD@cluster0.e2fw3.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majorhostity' ) db = client . user_login Here we import the pymongo library and use it to connect to our MongoDB instance. Replace YOURUSERNAME and YOURPASSWORD with your data capsule account information. Create the user class For Flask Login to work, we need to create a User class. This User class will contain information pertaining to the user that is currently logged in to our sleep tracker. Flask Login expects us to implement four methods in our User class: is_authenticated , is_active , is_anonymous and get_id . Rather than implementing all of these ourselves, we will have our User class inherit from Flask's UserMixin , which provides generic implementations for the first three, leaving us with only get_id . In addition, we'll need to implement our own load_user and check_password methods. Below the line db = client.user_login , enter the following code: class User ( UserMixin ): def __init__ ( self , username ): self . username = username def get_id ( self ): return self . username Here we've created the class, inherited from UserMixin and implemented the get_id method, which simply returns the user's username. To facilitate user login, we need to implement two methods, load_user and check_password . Let's implement load_user first. This method will be used to fetch a user from the MongoDB database corresponding to the username entered in the login form. Add the following code to the User class: @login_manager . user_loader def load_user ( username ): user = db . users . find_one ({ \"username\" : username }) if user is None : return None return User ( username = user [ 'username' ]) The decorate @login_manager.user_loader tells the login_manager to use this method to load users. Now let's add a check_password method. This method will be called to determine whether a user has entered the correct password for the username they specify. When we register users, we will hash their passwords with the bcrypt one-way encryption function before storing them in MongoDB. This will keep our users' passwords secret from us and, should our application be compromised in future, ensure that hackers cannot easily recover our users' passwords and use them on other websites those users may have account on. Therefore, when checking the password a user has entered on login, we need to hash this input with bcrypt before comparing it to the password entry in our MongoDB database. To do this, add the following code to the User class: @staticmethod def check_password ( password_entered , password ): if bcrypt . check_password_hash ( password , password_entered ): return True return False By making check_password a static method , we enabled it to be called without instantiating an instance of our User class. That's all we need for user login. Now we need to link our login and registration form to this functionality. Add functionality to the login and register buttons When a user clicks the register button, we will create a new user document in our MongoDB users collection, containing their username and hashed password. When a user clicks \"Login\", we will log them in if they've entered a valid username and password combination and redirect them to the main.html file. To do this, we'll create a new function that handles login and registration. Add the following code below the def login() function: @app . route ( \"/\" , methods = [ \"POST\" ]) def login_or_register (): if request . method == 'POST' : name_entered = str ( request . form . get ( 'user_name' )) # Get username and password from form pw_entered = str ( request . form . get ( 'user_pw' )) if request . form . get ( 'login' ): # Log in logic user = db . users . find_one ({ 'username' : name_entered }) if user and User . check_password ( pw_entered , user [ 'password' ]): usr_obj = User ( username = user [ 'username' ]) login_user ( usr_obj ) return redirect ( url_for ( 'main' )) else : return \"Incorrect username or password.\" elif request . form . get ( 'register' ): # Register logic # Validate username and password if not re . match ( \"[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,20}\" , name_entered ): return \"Username must be between 1 and 20 characters. Letters, numbers and underscores allowed.\" if len ( pw_entered ) < 8 : return \"Password must be at least 8 characters.\" if db . users . find_one ({ 'username' : name_entered }): return \"User already exists.\" new_user = { 'username' : name_entered , 'password' : bcrypt . generate_password_hash ( pw_entered ) } db . users . insert_one ( new_user ) # insert new user to db return redirect ( url_for ( 'login' )) # redirect after register First, note the POST method. As mentioned when we created our login.html file, using a POST method for user login and registration allows our application to transmit username and information more securely and allows us to differentiate between a user login or registration ( POST ) and a user merely visiting the page ( GET ). If the login button is pressed ( if request.form.get('login') ), we check our MongoDB for a username that matches the one entered. Then we check if the password entered matches that user's password in the MongoDB. If check_password evaluates to true, we log the user in and redirect to the main route (which we'll create in the next part of this series . Otherwise, we provide the user with an error message. To redirect users, we use Flask's redirect function and url_for functions. The url_for function finds the main route, and the redirect function sends users to that route. If a user clicks \"Register\", we first validate the username and password they've provided. We're restricting usernames to a length of 20 characters, containing only alphanumeric characters and underscores. We're also ensuring that the chosen password is eight or more characters long. We then check whether the username they're trying to use is already taken. If their username and password are acceptable, we create a new_user dictionary with the specified name and a bcrypt hash of the specified password, which we then insert it into our MongoDB. Then we send the user back to the login page. Trying out the login system We've implemented the login and register buttons.

Flask expects to find HTML files in a directory named templates and static content such as CSS stylesheets and images in a directory named static . In the sleep-tracker directory, create both of these directories. Inside templates , create three files: base.html , login.html , and main.html . base.html will contain the skeleton for our website's other HTML pages. login.html will contain the HTML for the main page of our web application. Here, users will log in or register an account with our sleep tracker. main.html will contain the HTML for the page where users will enter their sleep data and view a graph of this data. We'll deal with this file in the second part of this tutorial. Next, open the static directory and create a file named style.css . This will be the only file in this directory, and will conain the CSS style for our website. Finally, in the main sleep-tracker directory, create a file named app.py .

When Flask serves our login.html or main.html pages, it will replace the {% block content %}{% endblock %} with that page's unique content. Any code between {% and %} or {{ and }} is Jinja syntax, which is largely similar to Python code. Flask will evaluate this code before rendering HTML files and serving them to users. In this example, we use Jinja syntax to call Flask's url_for() function. To link our stylesheet, Flask uses the url_for() function to find the style.css file in the static directory.","title":"Base.html"},{"location":"tutorials/develop-persistent-sleep-tracker-part-1/#creating-the-login-page","text":"Now that we've created the base.html file, we can implement our login.html file.

For example, we might want to have a head block that defines some page-specific content that needs to be in the HTML <head> tag. On this page, we've created a form containing input fields for users to enter their username and password, as well as login and register buttons. Note the POST HTTP method \u2013 this will ensure that the username and password are sent as POST parameters in the HTTP request body, rather than as GET parameters in the URL.

This will help us to save time and avoid common usability and security pitfalls. We will store user information in the database we created at the beginning of this tutorial . First, let's import the functionality we'll need from: + flask-login , flask-bcrypt , to handle users. + pymongo , to interface with MongoDB. + re , to validate user input. Enter the following code below the line that starts with from flask import : from flask_login import LoginManager , UserMixin , login_required , login_user , logout_user , current_user from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt import pymongo , re Now we can create an instance of the LoginManager class and set a secret key for our application. Just below the line that defines app , add: app . config [ 'SECRET_KEY' ] = 'your-secret-key-here' login_manager = LoginManager ( app ) This class does exactly what it says \u2013 manages logged in users and communicates any necessary information about a user to Flask. Replace your-secret-key-here with a long randomly generated string. UUIDs are good for this purpose. You can generate one with the following terminal command: python3 -c 'import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4().hex.upper())' Next, we need to initialise a bcrypt object for our application. Add the following code below the line that defines login_manager : bcrypt = Bcrypt ( app ) When a user registers with our sleep tracker, we'll create a new entry in our MongoDB with the user's username and password. That way, when a user logs in to our sleep tracker, we can see if the information they entered matches the information in our MongoDB. Beneath the last line we added, add the following: client = pymongo . MongoClient ( 'mongodb+srv://YOURUSERNAME:YOURPASSWORD@cluster0.e2fw3.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majorhostity' ) db = client . user_login Here we import the pymongo library and use it to connect to our MongoDB instance. Replace YOURUSERNAME and YOURPASSWORD with your data capsule account information.","title":"Handling User Registration and Login"},{"location":"tutorials/develop-persistent-sleep-tracker-part-1/#create-the-user-class","text":"For Flask Login to work, we need to create a User class. This User class will contain information pertaining to the user that is currently logged in to our sleep tracker. Flask Login expects us to implement four methods in our User class: is_authenticated , is_active , is_anonymous and get_id . Rather than implementing all of these ourselves, we will have our User class inherit from Flask's UserMixin , which provides generic implementations for the first three, leaving us with only get_id . In addition, we'll need to implement our own load_user and check_password methods. Below the line db = client.user_login , enter the following code: class User ( UserMixin ): def __init__ ( self , username ): self . username = username def get_id ( self ): return self . username Here we've created the class, inherited from UserMixin and implemented the get_id method, which simply returns the user's username. To facilitate user login, we need to implement two methods, load_user and check_password . Let's implement load_user first. This method will be used to fetch a user from the MongoDB database corresponding to the username entered in the login form. Add the following code to the User class: @login_manager . user_loader def load_user ( username ): user = db . users . find_one ({ \"username\" : username }) if user is None : return None return User ( username = user [ 'username' ]) The decorate @login_manager.user_loader tells the login_manager to use this method to load users. Now let's add a check_password method. This method will be called to determine whether a user has entered the correct password for the username they specify. When we register users, we will hash their passwords with the bcrypt one-way encryption function before storing them in MongoDB. This will keep our users' passwords secret from us and, should our application be compromised in future, ensure that hackers cannot easily recover our users' passwords and use them on other websites those users may have account on. Therefore, when checking the password a user has entered on login, we need to hash this input with bcrypt before comparing it to the password entry in our MongoDB database. To do this, add the following code to the User class: @staticmethod def check_password ( password_entered , password ): if bcrypt . check_password_hash ( password , password_entered ): return True return False By making check_password a static method , we enabled it to be called without instantiating an instance of our User class. That's all we need for user login. Now we need to link our login and registration form to this functionality.","title":"Create the user class"},{"location":"tutorials/develop-persistent-sleep-tracker-part-1/#add-functionality-to-the-login-and-register-buttons","text":"When a user clicks the register button, we will create a new user document in our MongoDB users collection, containing their username and hashed password. When a user clicks \"Login\", we will log them in if they've entered a valid username and password combination and redirect them to the main.html file. To do this, we'll create a new function that handles login and registration. Add the following code below the def login() function: @app . route ( \"/\" , methods = [ \"POST\" ]) def login_or_register (): if request . method == 'POST' : name_entered = str ( request . form . get ( 'user_name' )) # Get username and password from form pw_entered = str ( request . form . get ( 'user_pw' )) if request . form . get ( 'login' ): # Log in logic user = db . users . find_one ({ 'username' : name_entered }) if user and User . check_password ( pw_entered , user [ 'password' ]): usr_obj = User ( username = user [ 'username' ]) login_user ( usr_obj ) return redirect ( url_for ( 'main' )) else : return \"Incorrect username or password.\" elif request . form . get ( 'register' ): # Register logic # Validate username and password if not re . match ( \"[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,20}\" , name_entered ): return \"Username must be between 1 and 20 characters. Letters, numbers and underscores allowed.\" if len ( pw_entered ) < 8 : return \"Password must be at least 8 characters.\" if db . users . find_one ({ 'username' : name_entered }): return \"User already exists.\" new_user = { 'username' : name_entered , 'password' : bcrypt . generate_password_hash ( pw_entered ) } db . users . insert_one ( new_user ) # insert new user to db return redirect ( url_for ( 'login' )) # redirect after register First, note the POST method. As mentioned when we created our login.html file, using a POST method for user login and registration allows our application to transmit username and information more securely and allows us to differentiate between a user login or registration ( POST ) and a user merely visiting the page ( GET ). If the login button is pressed ( if request.form.get('login') ), we check our MongoDB for a username that matches the one entered. Then we check if the password entered matches that user's password in the MongoDB. If check_password evaluates to true, we log the user in and redirect to the main route (which we'll create in the next part of this series . Otherwise, we provide the user with an error message. To redirect users, we use Flask's redirect function and url_for functions. The url_for function finds the main route, and the redirect function sends users to that route. If a user clicks \"Register\", we first validate the username and password they've provided. We're restricting usernames to a length of 20 characters, containing only alphanumeric characters and underscores. We're also ensuring that the chosen password is eight or more characters long. We then check whether the username they're trying to use is already taken. If their username and password are acceptable, we create a new_user dictionary with the specified name and a bcrypt hash of the specified password, which we then insert it into our MongoDB. Then we send the user back to the login page.","title":"Add functionality to the login and register buttons"},{"location":"tutorials/develop-persistent-sleep-tracker-part-1/#trying-out-the-login-system","text":"We've implemented the login and register buttons.

Recap In the first part of this series , we built a web application with user registration and login using Python's Flask web framework and a hosted NoSQL MongoDB database for data persistence. We will now build on the code we wrote in that tutorial, so you must have completed it. In this second part of the series, we'll implement the logic that allows users to enter their sleep data and see that data on an interactive graph, generated using Plotly . Registered users will be able to log the number of hours slept on different days and visualise this data as a graph. Creating the Sleep Tracker Front-end At the end of our last tutorial, we saw a blank page when we logged in and were redirected to the application's /main page. This happened because our main.html file was empty, so let's add some content to it. We'll need the following: A form with fields for the date and hours slept, so users can provide sleep data for different days. A way to view a graph of this data. A logout button, that logs the user out. To do all of this, we will first need to build a main.html containing both static HTML and dynamic Jinja template components that will change depending on which user is logged in and what sleep data they've provided. We will also implement some front-end JavaScript code to make our sleep data graph interactive. Let's add the sleep data logging form first. Open the main.html file in the templates directory. Add the following: {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block content %} < h2 > Hey, {{ user['username'] }}! Let's track your sleep. </ h2 > < form action = \"\" method = \"POST\" > < ul > < li > < label for = \"time\" > Time Slept (hours): </ label > < input type = \"text\" id = \"time\" name = \"time\" > </ li > < li > < label for = \"date\" > Date: </ label > < input type = \"date\" id = \"date\" name = \"date\" value = \"\" > </ li > < li class = \"button\" > < input type = \"submit\" name = 'submit' value = 'Submit' > < input type = \"submit\" name = 'graph' value = 'View Graph' > < input type = \"submit\" name = 'logout' value = 'Logout' > </ li > </ ul > </ form > {% endblock %} This works similarly to the login.html file we created in the previous tutorial, with base.html acting as the page skeleton and our unique content being entered between the {% block content %} and {% endblock %} lines. We also ensure that our form uses the POST method so we can differentiate between a user visiting the page and clicking one of the three form buttons. To determine which button a user has clicked in a given POST request, we'll use the button's HTML name attribute ( submit , graph or logout ) in Flask. Notice the Jinja snippet {{ user['username'] }} . This will display data sent from our Flask back-end code in the page \u2013 in this case, the user's name. The <input type=\"date\" id=\"date\" name=\"date\" value=\"\"> line creates an interactive calendar so users can click on dates rather than typing them out. Adding Sleep Data Submission and Logout In the app.py file, add the following line below the app = Flask(__name__) line. app . config [ 'plotting' ] = False Here we add a new entry in our Flask application's configuration settings. This will come in handy soon \u2013 we'll use this line to tell whether or not a user has clicked the \"View Graph\" button in our main.html file. If a user has clicked the button, we'll set this line to \"True\" and a graph with the user's sleep data will display. Now, we can implement the functionality for our \"Submit\", \"View Graph\" and \"Logout\" buttons. Add the following code below the main() function. @app . route ( '/main' , methods = [ 'POST' ]) def submit_sleep (): if request . form . get ( 'submit' ): # if submitting new sleep data time_entered = float ( request . form . get ( 'time' )) date_entered = request . form . get ( 'date' ) message = add_sleep ( time_entered , date_entered , db . users . find_one ({ 'username' : current_user . get_id ()})) if message : return message if request . form . get ( 'logout' ): logout_user () app . config [ 'plotting' ] = False return 'You logged out!' elif request . form . get ( 'graph' ): app . config [ 'plotting' ] = True return redirect ( url_for ( 'main' )) This function operates similarly as our login_or_register function: If a user clicks \"Submit\", the data they entered will be stored in their MongoDB entry via the add_sleep function (that we'll create next). This function will return a string with an error message if it encounters an error, and None if it succeeds. If a user clicks \"Logout\", the user will be logged out. If a user clicks \"View Graph\", the app.config['plotting'] entry is set to True . Later, we'll expand main.html to display the graph. Let's wrap up our button functionality by creating the add_sleep function that is called when a user clicks \"Submit\". Add the following code above the submit_logout_plot function to create the add_sleep function: def add_sleep ( time , date , user ): if not re . match ( \"[0-9] {4} -[0-1][0-9]-[0-3][0-9]\" , date ): return \"Invalid date supplied.\" if time < 0.0 or time > 24.0 : return \"Sleep time must be between 0 and 24 hours.\" if 'date' in user : user [ 'date' ] . append ( date ) user [ 'time' ] . append ( time ) else : # adding sleep data for the first time user [ 'date' ] = [ date ] user [ 'time' ] = [ time ] # Update MongoDB db . users . update_one ({ 'username' : user [ 'username' ] }, { '$set' : { 'date' : user [ 'date' ], 'time' : user [ 'time' ] }}) Our add_sleep function takes three variables: time : The number of hours slept that the user entered. date : The calendar date the user selected. user : The user's MongoDB entry. First, we validate the user's input to ensure that a correctly formatted date has been provided and that the time given is not a negative number or larger than 24. If either value does not pass validation, we return a relevant error message from the function without writing to the database. Otherwise we continue. If a user has never entered any sleep data, we add a new 'date' and 'time' entry to the user's MongoDB entry with the date and time entered. Otherwise, we take the data they entered and add it to their existing sleep data. Finally, we update the user's MongoDB entry with db.users.update_one . We've implemented functionality for all three buttons. Now we need to modify the main() function to pass the current user's data to main.html . This will allow us to display their username on the page, and to graph their sleep data. Find the main() function and modify it like so: @app . route ( '/main' ) def main (): if current_user . get_id () is None : return redirect ( url_for ( 'login' )) # redirect to login page if not logged in user_data = db . users . find_one ({ 'username' : current_user . get_id () }) return render_template ( \"main.html\" , user = user_data , plot = app . config [ 'plotting' ]) First, we leverage Flask-Login's anonymous users functionality to check if the current user is not logged in and, if so, we redirect them to the login page. If the current user is logged it, we retrieve their MongoDB entry and assign it to user_data . Then we pass this variable to the render_template function as user . This is how the line below will access and display the user's name. < h2 > Hey, {{ user['username'] }}! Let's track your sleep. </ h2 > As user_data contains the entire MongoDB user entry, our template will be able to access the current user's sleep data from the user variable as well. We've also passed the template the value of app.config['plotting'] in plot . This is how our application will know whether or not to display a graph on the /main page. All that's left now is to add the sleep data graph in our main.html file. After that, we can deploy our application to Code Capsules. Adding the Plotly Graph As mentioned at the beginning of the article, we'll add the ability to graph sleep data with the help of Plotly . Plotly provides an external JavaScript library that we can use to create interactive graphs for the web. In the main.html file, find the </form> line. Right below this line, add the following: {% if plot %} < script src = \"https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js\" ></ script > < div id = \"graph\" > < script > var x = {{ user [ 'date' ] | safe }}; var y = {{ user [ 'time' ] | safe }}; var trace1 = { x : x , y : y , type : 'bar' }; var data = [ trace1 ]; var layout = { title : { text : 'My Sleep' , font : { family : 'Courier New, monospace' , size : 24 }, xref : 'paper' , x : 0.05 , }, xaxis : { title : { text : 'Date' , font : { family : 'Courier New, monospace' , size : 18 , color : '#7f7f7f' } }, }, yaxis : { title : { text : 'Time Slept (hrs)' , font : { family : 'Courier New, monospace' , size : 18 , color : '#7f7f7f' } } } }; Plotly . newPlot ( 'graph' , data , layout ); </ script > </ div > {% endif %} Let's break this down, starting with the line {% if plot %} . This line references the plot variable we created in our app.py file in the main function. If someone has clicked \"View Graph\", we set plot to true. If plot is true, the HTML between {% if plot %} and {% endif %} will be included in the page served to the user, otherwise it will be left out. The line <script src=\"https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js\"></script> imports the Plotly graphing library. This is similar to an import statement in Python. Under this line, we see a lot of code enclosed in <script>...</script> tags. This is all JavaScript code. In this code, we create two variables, x and y , which contain arrays of the dates and number of hours slept that a user has logged. Note that we have set these variables as safe , which means that Jinja will not attempt to escape or encode any of the characters within them when it renders the HTML. This is dangerous to do with user input, which is why we validated both the date and time values in our Python code. If we had not validated them, a malicious user might be able to supply JavaScript code in the date or time input fields and alter the behaviour of this page. The code inside var trace1 = {...} tells Plotly which data to use for the x and y axes, and the type of graph we'll make \u2013 a bar graph. All the code in var layout = {...} effects things like x and y axis labelling, font type, and size of font. Customise this to your liking! Finally, The line Plotly.newPlot('graph', data, layout) creates the actual graph and displays it to a user. Try running the application by opening a terminal in the sleep-tracker directory, activating the virtual environment and entering flask run . You should be able to register a new user account, log in, enter sleep data, and view your graph. Preparing for Deployment With our sleep tracker functionally complete, we need to make one last modification to our app.py file and add some files in the sleep-tracker directory before we can push our code to GitHub and deploy it on Code Capsules. Creating environment variables Before we push our code to GitHub, we need to remove our app.config['SECRET_KEY'] and the MongoDB user credentials. If we were to push our code now, anyone could use our secret key to forge user sessions on our application or our MongoDB credentials to alter our database. Luckily, there is an easy fix. First, save your secret key and MongoDB credentials somewhere safe, outside of this project's directory so that you don't lose them. Then, at the top of app.py , add the line: import os Then, replace the line: app . config [ 'SECRET_KEY' ] = 'your-secret-key-here' with this: app . config [ 'SECRET_KEY' ] = os . getenv ( 'SECRET_KEY' ) And replace this line: client = pymongo . MongoClient ( 'mongodb+srv://YOURUSERNAME:<password>@cluster0.e2fw3.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majorhostity' ) with this: client = pymongo . MongoClient ( 'MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING' ) os.getenv('SECRET_KEY') and os.getenv('MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING') will look for environment variables with the names \"SECRET_KEY\" and \"MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING\". When we host the sleep tracker application on Code Capsules, we'll set these environment variables to the values we removed from the code. Creating a Procfile and requirements.txt Code Capsules requires a couple of files to deploy our application: Procfile and requirements.txt . The first one tells Code Capsules how to run our application, and the second one tells it which libraries it needs to install. To create the Procfile : Create a file named Procfile in your project directory (do not add a file extension). Open the Procfile , enter web: gunicorn app:app , and save the file. This tells Code Capsules to use the Gunicorn WSGI server to run app.py . In the same terminal, activate the virtual environment and enter pip3 freeze > requirements.txt to create requirements.txt and populate it with all the libraries we've used to create this application. Now we can push our code to GitHub. Create a GitHub repository and send every file and directory to GitHub, except for virtual env's env directory . Deploying the Sleep Tracker to Code Capsules With all of the files on GitHub, we can deploy the sleep tracer to Code Capsules: Log in to Code Capsules, and create a Team and Space as necessary. Link Code Capsules to the GitHub repository created previously . Enter your Code Capsules Space. Create a new Capsule, selecting the \"Backend\" capsule type. Select the GitHub repository containing the sleep tracker \u2013 leave \"Repo subpath\" empty and click \"Next\". Leave the \"Run Command\" blank and click \"Create Capsule\". Now we just need to set those environment variables we mentioned previously . Creating environment variables in Code Capsules Let's create set the environment variables so our sleep tracker will work properly: Navigate to your Capsule. Click the \"Config\" tab. Add two environment variables, one named \"SECRET_KEY\" and another \"MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING\". Enter the secret key and connection string values you saved earlier. When done, make sure to click \"Update\". Now the sleep tracker is ready to try out! The application is complete. What Next? There are many ways to expand or improve this application. Some ideas include: Improve the application's styling \u2013 it's fairly simple right now. If you want to learn more about CSS styling, this tutorial written by Mozilla is a great place to start. Add a way for users to keep track of other data (calories, daily notes, exercise). Display better looking error messages, preferably somewhere in the current page.","title":"Persistent Sleep Tracker Part 2"},{"location":"tutorials/develop-persistent-sleep-tracker-part-2/#developing-a-persistent-sleep-tracker-part-2-tracking-and-graphing-sleep-data","text":"This is the second part of our sleep tracker web application tutorial, covering the creation of the sleep tracker interface.","title":"Developing a Persistent Sleep Tracker Part 2: Tracking and Graphing Sleep Data"},{"location":"tutorials/develop-persistent-sleep-tracker-part-2/#recap","text":"In the first part of this series , we built a web application with user registration and login using Python's Flask web framework and a hosted NoSQL MongoDB database for data persistence. We will now build on the code we wrote in that tutorial, so you must have completed it. In this second part of the series, we'll implement the logic that allows users to enter their sleep data and see that data on an interactive graph, generated using Plotly . Registered users will be able to log the number of hours slept on different days and visualise this data as a graph.","title":"Recap"},{"location":"tutorials/develop-persistent-sleep-tracker-part-2/#creating-the-sleep-tracker-front-end","text":"At the end of our last tutorial, we saw a blank page when we logged in and were redirected to the application's /main page. This happened because our main.html file was empty, so let's add some content to it. We'll need the following: A form with fields for the date and hours slept, so users can provide sleep data for different days. A way to view a graph of this data. A logout button, that logs the user out. To do all of this, we will first need to build a main.html containing both static HTML and dynamic Jinja template components that will change depending on which user is logged in and what sleep data they've provided. We will also implement some front-end JavaScript code to make our sleep data graph interactive. Let's add the sleep data logging form first. Open the main.html file in the templates directory. Add the following: {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block content %} < h2 > Hey, {{ user['username'] }}! Let's track your sleep. </ h2 > < form action = \"\" method = \"POST\" > < ul > < li > < label for = \"time\" > Time Slept (hours): </ label > < input type = \"text\" id = \"time\" name = \"time\" > </ li > < li > < label for = \"date\" > Date: </ label > < input type = \"date\" id = \"date\" name = \"date\" value = \"\" > </ li > < li class = \"button\" > < input type = \"submit\" name = 'submit' value = 'Submit' > < input type = \"submit\" name = 'graph' value = 'View Graph' > < input type = \"submit\" name = 'logout' value = 'Logout' > </ li > </ ul > </ form > {% endblock %} This works similarly to the login.html file we created in the previous tutorial, with base.html acting as the page skeleton and our unique content being entered between the {% block content %} and {% endblock %} lines. We also ensure that our form uses the POST method so we can differentiate between a user visiting the page and clicking one of the three form buttons. To determine which button a user has clicked in a given POST request, we'll use the button's HTML name attribute ( submit , graph or logout ) in Flask. Notice the Jinja snippet {{ user['username'] }} . This will display data sent from our Flask back-end code in the page \u2013 in this case, the user's name. The <input type=\"date\" id=\"date\" name=\"date\" value=\"\"> line creates an interactive calendar so users can click on dates rather than typing them out.","title":"Creating the Sleep Tracker Front-end"},{"location":"tutorials/develop-persistent-sleep-tracker-part-2/#adding-sleep-data-submission-and-logout","text":"In the app.py file, add the following line below the app = Flask(__name__) line. app . config [ 'plotting' ] = False Here we add a new entry in our Flask application's configuration settings. This will come in handy soon \u2013 we'll use this line to tell whether or not a user has clicked the \"View Graph\" button in our main.html file. If a user has clicked the button, we'll set this line to \"True\" and a graph with the user's sleep data will display. Now, we can implement the functionality for our \"Submit\", \"View Graph\" and \"Logout\" buttons. Add the following code below the main() function. @app . route ( '/main' , methods = [ 'POST' ]) def submit_sleep (): if request . form . get ( 'submit' ): # if submitting new sleep data time_entered = float ( request . form . get ( 'time' )) date_entered = request . form . get ( 'date' ) message = add_sleep ( time_entered , date_entered , db . users . find_one ({ 'username' : current_user . get_id ()})) if message : return message if request . form . get ( 'logout' ): logout_user () app . config [ 'plotting' ] = False return 'You logged out!' elif request . form . get ( 'graph' ): app . config [ 'plotting' ] = True return redirect ( url_for ( 'main' )) This function operates similarly as our login_or_register function: If a user clicks \"Submit\", the data they entered will be stored in their MongoDB entry via the add_sleep function (that we'll create next). This function will return a string with an error message if it encounters an error, and None if it succeeds. If a user clicks \"Logout\", the user will be logged out. If a user clicks \"View Graph\", the app.config['plotting'] entry is set to True . Later, we'll expand main.html to display the graph. Let's wrap up our button functionality by creating the add_sleep function that is called when a user clicks \"Submit\". Add the following code above the submit_logout_plot function to create the add_sleep function: def add_sleep ( time , date , user ): if not re . match ( \"[0-9] {4} -[0-1][0-9]-[0-3][0-9]\" , date ): return \"Invalid date supplied.\" if time < 0.0 or time > 24.0 : return \"Sleep time must be between 0 and 24 hours.\" if 'date' in user : user [ 'date' ] . append ( date ) user [ 'time' ] . append ( time ) else : # adding sleep data for the first time user [ 'date' ] = [ date ] user [ 'time' ] = [ time ] # Update MongoDB db . users . update_one ({ 'username' : user [ 'username' ] }, { '$set' : { 'date' : user [ 'date' ], 'time' : user [ 'time' ] }}) Our add_sleep function takes three variables: time : The number of hours slept that the user entered. date : The calendar date the user selected. user : The user's MongoDB entry. First, we validate the user's input to ensure that a correctly formatted date has been provided and that the time given is not a negative number or larger than 24. If either value does not pass validation, we return a relevant error message from the function without writing to the database. Otherwise we continue. If a user has never entered any sleep data, we add a new 'date' and 'time' entry to the user's MongoDB entry with the date and time entered. Otherwise, we take the data they entered and add it to their existing sleep data. Finally, we update the user's MongoDB entry with db.users.update_one . We've implemented functionality for all three buttons. Now we need to modify the main() function to pass the current user's data to main.html . This will allow us to display their username on the page, and to graph their sleep data. Find the main() function and modify it like so: @app . route ( '/main' ) def main (): if current_user . get_id () is None : return redirect ( url_for ( 'login' )) # redirect to login page if not logged in user_data = db . users . find_one ({ 'username' : current_user . get_id () }) return render_template ( \"main.html\" , user = user_data , plot = app . config [ 'plotting' ]) First, we leverage Flask-Login's anonymous users functionality to check if the current user is not logged in and, if so, we redirect them to the login page. If the current user is logged it, we retrieve their MongoDB entry and assign it to user_data . Then we pass this variable to the render_template function as user . This is how the line below will access and display the user's name. < h2 > Hey, {{ user['username'] }}! Let's track your sleep. </ h2 > As user_data contains the entire MongoDB user entry, our template will be able to access the current user's sleep data from the user variable as well. We've also passed the template the value of app.config['plotting'] in plot . This is how our application will know whether or not to display a graph on the /main page. All that's left now is to add the sleep data graph in our main.html file. After that, we can deploy our application to Code Capsules.","title":"Adding Sleep Data Submission and Logout"},{"location":"tutorials/develop-persistent-sleep-tracker-part-2/#adding-the-plotly-graph","text":"As mentioned at the beginning of the article, we'll add the ability to graph sleep data with the help of Plotly . Plotly provides an external JavaScript library that we can use to create interactive graphs for the web. In the main.html file, find the </form> line. Right below this line, add the following: {% if plot %} < script src = \"https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js\" ></ script > < div id = \"graph\" > < script > var x = {{ user [ 'date' ] | safe }}; var y = {{ user [ 'time' ] | safe }}; var trace1 = { x : x , y : y , type : 'bar' }; var data = [ trace1 ]; var layout = { title : { text : 'My Sleep' , font : { family : 'Courier New, monospace' , size : 24 }, xref : 'paper' , x : 0.05 , }, xaxis : { title : { text : 'Date' , font : { family : 'Courier New, monospace' , size : 18 , color : '#7f7f7f' } }, }, yaxis : { title : { text : 'Time Slept (hrs)' , font : { family : 'Courier New, monospace' , size : 18 , color : '#7f7f7f' } } } }; Plotly . newPlot ( 'graph' , data , layout ); </ script > </ div > {% endif %} Let's break this down, starting with the line {% if plot %} . This line references the plot variable we created in our app.py file in the main function. If someone has clicked \"View Graph\", we set plot to true. If plot is true, the HTML between {% if plot %} and {% endif %} will be included in the page served to the user, otherwise it will be left out. The line <script src=\"https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js\"></script> imports the Plotly graphing library. This is similar to an import statement in Python. Under this line, we see a lot of code enclosed in <script>...</script> tags. This is all JavaScript code. In this code, we create two variables, x and y , which contain arrays of the dates and number of hours slept that a user has logged. Note that we have set these variables as safe , which means that Jinja will not attempt to escape or encode any of the characters within them when it renders the HTML. This is dangerous to do with user input, which is why we validated both the date and time values in our Python code. If we had not validated them, a malicious user might be able to supply JavaScript code in the date or time input fields and alter the behaviour of this page. The code inside var trace1 = {...} tells Plotly which data to use for the x and y axes, and the type of graph we'll make \u2013 a bar graph. All the code in var layout = {...} effects things like x and y axis labelling, font type, and size of font. Customise this to your liking! Finally, The line Plotly.newPlot('graph', data, layout) creates the actual graph and displays it to a user. Try running the application by opening a terminal in the sleep-tracker directory, activating the virtual environment and entering flask run . You should be able to register a new user account, log in, enter sleep data, and view your graph.","title":"Adding the Plotly Graph"},{"location":"tutorials/develop-persistent-sleep-tracker-part-2/#preparing-for-deployment","text":"With our sleep tracker functionally complete, we need to make one last modification to our app.py file and add some files in the sleep-tracker directory before we can push our code to GitHub and deploy it on Code Capsules.","title":"Preparing for Deployment"},{"location":"tutorials/develop-persistent-sleep-tracker-part-2/#creating-environment-variables","text":"Before we push our code to GitHub, we need to remove our app.config['SECRET_KEY'] and the MongoDB user credentials.

Many web services and apps run off of multiple APIs in the background. Because APIs are so ubiquitous, it is very useful to learn the basics of how to build one. In this tutorial, we'll build a simple HTTP REST API to provide Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD for short) functions for a personal game catalogue. We'll secure it with HTTP Basic authentication , while allowing for an easy upgrade to a more secure scheme. We'll use MySQL as the data store, Node.js as the application language, and Code Capsules to host all the components. Overview and Requirements You'll need the following services and software set up for this tutorial: Git setup and installed, and a registered GitHub account . Node.js installed. A registered Code Capsules account. An IDE or text editor to create the project in. This tutorial was made using Visual Studio Code , but you can use any tool you like. The Postman app to interact with our API. Setting up the Project With our requirements in place, we can get started setting them up to work as needed for our game catalogue project. Creating a New Repo We need a place to store our code from which Code Capsules can deploy to a Capsule. Head over to GitHub and create a new repo. We're calling it game-api here, but you can give it any name. Choose a Node .gitignore file to get started. Then clone the new GitHub repo onto your computer and navigate to that directory in a terminal (or command prompt, if you're on Windows). Initialising the Base Project We'll use the Express generator to create the project base. Express is a lightweight web framework for Node.js. To create the base project, type in the following: npx express-generator --no-view npm install This creates a few files and folders that we can edit. The --no-view option tells the generator to skip adding an HTML view engine. This is because we don't need any views for an API. The command npm install downloads and installs all the dependencies and packages required by the base project. Open the folder with Visual Studio Code or an editor of your choice, and browse through the files to get familiar with them. The app.js file in the project root is the main entry point for the app. Great, it's time to push this boilerplate project up to Git. We can do it with the following commands, from the command prompt or terminal: git add . git commit -am 'added base files for project' git push origin Creating a New Backend Capsule We'll need a place to host our app. Log in to Code Capsules , and create a Team and Space as necessary. Link Code Capsules to the GitHub repository you created above. You can do this by clicking your username at the top right in Code Capsules, and choosing Edit Profile . Now you can click the GitHub button to link to a repo. Create a new Capsule, selecting the \"Backend\" capsule type. Select the GitHub repository. If you are only using the repo for this project, you can leave the Repo Subpath field empty. You may need to add your repo to the team repo if you haven't already. Click the Modify Team Repos to do so. Click Next , then on the following page, click Create Capsule . You can follow this in-depth guide if you'd like more information on linking to GitHub and creating an express.js Backend Capsule. Creating a New Data Capsule We'll need some data storage to store the files that are uploaded to the web drive. Create a new Capsule, selecting the \"Data Capsule\" type. Select \"MySQL\" as the Data Type. Choose a product size, and give it a name. Click \"Create Capsule\". You can follow the in-depth creation guide if you'd like more information on creating a Data Capsule. Link the Capsules To use the Data Capsule with the Backend Capsule, we need to link them. Head over to the Backend Capsule you created above, and click on the \"Configure\" tab. Then scroll down to \"Bind Data Capsule\", and click \"Bind\" under the name of the data capsule you created. After binding the Capsules, scroll up to the section \"Capsule Parameters\". You'll notice that an environment variable, DATABASE_URL , is automatically added containing the connection string to the MySQL database. We'll use this environment variable in the code to access the MySQL database. Writing the API Code Now that we have all our systems set up, we can get onto the coding part. Creating the Database Tables We need to set up our database with a table to store the list of all our games. We'll create a very simple table with the following columns: id title system year We don't have direct access to the Data Capsule and the MySQL database it's running. We can only access the Data Capsule from our Backend Capsule. So, to make a new table, we'll create a setup script which we can direct the Backend Capsule to run. Create a new file called setup.js in the root of your project. Now we need to install a package that will allow us connect to MySQL and send commands. We'll use MySQL2 . Use npm from the terminal to install this package: npm install mysql2 Now we can add the code to create the table. In the new setup.js file, add the following code: const mysql = require ( 'mysql2' ); console . log ( 'Setting up Database....' ); const connection = mysql . createConnection ( process . env . DATABASE_URL ); console . log ( 'Creating tables...' ); connection . execute ( ` create table games ( id int auto_increment, title varchar(500) not null, platform varchar(500) not null, year int not null, constraint games_pk primary key (id) ); ` , function ( err , results , fields ){ if ( err ) { console . error ( err ); } console . log ( results ); }); This code imports the mysql2 driver package. We write a boot message to the console, just so we can see when the code runs in the logs. Then we can create a new connection to the database, using the connection string that was automatically added to the DATABASE_URL environment variable when we bound the capsules. Then we use the execute function to send a SQL command to the database. The SQL command creates a new table with the columns defined above. It has a callback to let us know if the operation is a success or if it has an error. In both cases, we write the output to the console, so we'll be able to see what happened when we read the logs. Now, we need a way for the Backend Capsule to run this setup script. We can use the package.json file to register a new command that npm will be able to run. Open the package.json file and add in the following line to the scripts object: \"setup\" : \"node setup.js\" The complete package.json file should look like this now: { \"name\" : \"game-api\" , \"version\" : \"0.0.0\" , \"private\" : true , \"scripts\" : { \"start\" : \"node ./bin/www\" , \"setup\" : \"node setup.js\" }, \"dependencies\" : { \"cookie-parser\" : \"~1.4.4\" , \"debug\" : \"~2.6.9\" , \"express\" : \"~4.16.1\" , \"morgan\" : \"~1.9.1\" , \"mysql2\" : \"^2.3.0\" } } We'll need to let our Backend Capsule know to run this script. Navigate to the \"Configure\" tab on the Backend Capsule, and scroll down to the \"Run Command\" section. Change this to: npm run setup Click \"Update Capsule\" to save this new setting. Let's commit the above code to the repo, and push it up so that Code Capsules can run it. Commit and push using the following commands in the terminal: git add . git commit -am 'added database setup script' git push origin If you navigate to the \"Logs\" tab on the Backend Capsule, you should see the script booting up and the result of the CREATE TABLE command. Once this is done, you can change the \"Run Command\" under the \"Configure\" tab back to: npm run start Remember to click \"Update Capsule\" to save this. Adding a Read Route Our database is set up with a new table. Let's add some code to create an API route to read from this table. To keep the solution neater, we'll add a new file to contain the API route code. Add a new file called games.js in the routes folder in your project, with the following code: var express = require ( 'express' ); const mysql = require ( 'mysql2' ); var router = express . Router (); const connection = mysql . createConnection ( process . env . DATABASE_URL ); router . get ( '/' , function ( req , res , next ){ connection . query ( `SELECT * FROM games` , queryResults ); function queryResults ( err , results , fields ){ if ( err ) return next ( err ); return res . json ( results ); } }); module . exports = router ; This code imports the Express module so that we can construct a router , and the mysql2 module so that we can connect to the database. We create a router , which is an object that allows us to group routes and middleware together logically. We'll add all our CRUD routes to this router object. Then we create a new database connection, as we did in our setup script. Express routers allow us to add routes using the following structure: router . METHOD ( PATH , HANDLER ) METHOD is one of the standard HTTP request methods to use. PATH is the relative part of the server URL to get to the route, and HANDLER is a function that we want run when the route is accessed. To create the read route, we use the HTTP GET verb, which can be configured using the get method on the router. Since we need no parameters, we set the path to / . Then we add our handler function. The function accepts 3 arguments from the Express router: req , which is all the incoming request parameters and context from the client. res , a results object where we can specify how to return data to the client. next , a function that we can call to hand control to the next middleware in our route, if there is any. If we want to signal an error, we can pass an argument to next , and Express will return an error to the client with the data in that argument. In our get handler, we run a SQL query to select all entries from the database. The query method takes a SQL query and a callback function. This callback is called with the results or error from the SQL server. We use a separate named function as our callback. This is mainly a stylistic choice - we could write the function inline, but our code would be less readable, as it would have many indentations and creep to the right-hand side of the screen. In the callback, we check if the err , or error, parameter is set. If it is, we use the next function along with the error to exit the route early. This will send an error message to the client. If there is no error, we send the results of the SQL query back, formatted as JSON . Now that we have the router set up and our first route created, we can hook them up to the main Express app. Open the app.js file in the route folder and add the following code above the line var app = express(); : var gamesRouter = require ( './routes/games' ); This adds a reference to the router we defined in the game.js file. Now, let's use this reference to add the router to the Express app. Add the following line just above the module.exports = app; : app . use ( '/games' , [ gamesRouter ]); This mounts the route at the path /games on our server. Let's test all of this by committing and pushing these changes: git add . git commit -am 'added get route for games' git push origin If you visit the Code Capsules dashboard for the Backend Capsule, you should see a note that it's building. Once it's finished building, head over to your site in a browser and navigate to the /games route. You should see it return an empty array: This works, but is not very interesting! Let's add a create route so that we can add new game entries. Adding a Create Route We'll use the HTTP POST method as the verb for creating a new game in the catalogue. For the create route, it would be nice to return the newly created entry, along with the id automatically created by MySQL for the entry. To do this, we'll first need to INSERT the new data into the database, and then run a SELECT command to retrieve the fully created database object. We can use the concept of \"middleware\" in Express to achieve this. Each route allows us to chain multiple handlers to it, with each handler running one after the other. This is the core concept of middleware. So to implement our create route with its two distinct operations, we can chain 2 handlers, like this: router . post ( '/' , [ functionOne , functionTwo ]) Here, functionOne can pass control to functionTwo by calling the next() parameter, which is passed into each handler by Express. We can also pass custom information from one handler to another by adding it onto the req object, which is also passed to each handler by Express. Ok, enough theory, let's add this code in games.js above the line module.exports = router; using what we know from above: router . post ( '/' , [ addNewGame , returnGameById ]); function addNewGame ( req , res , next ){ connection . query ( `INSERT INTO games (title, platform, year) VALUES (?, ?, ?)` , [ req . body . title , req . body . platform , req . body . year ], queryResults ); function queryResults ( err , results , fields ){ if ( err ) return next ( err ); req . body . id = results . insertId return next (); } } function returnGameById ( req , res , done ){ connection . query ( ` SELECT * FROM games WHERE id = ? ` , [ req . body . id ], queryResults ); function queryResults ( err , results , fields ){ if ( err ) return next ( err ); return res . json ( results ); } } We've implemented each of the handlers as separate, named functions. You could implement both as inline functions, but again, it's a stylistic choice to improve readability. Also, by writing each handler as a named function, the list of the functions passed to the router is almost self-documenting, telling us the steps the route takes. Lastly, we can also re-use each of the handlers in other routes if we need to. The first handler, addNewGame , uses a SQL INSERT query to create a new database row. Note the ? placeholders in the query. This feature of the MySQL2 package allows us to pass in arguments to the query, instead of concating the query with our incoming values. The values passed in from the client can be found on the req.body object, neatly parsed into JSON by Express. We can pass these values in an array as an argument to the query function. The function will substitute each ? for a value, in the order that they are passed in the array. We use a function queryResults as we did for the get route, as our callback. Note here that the results parameter on this occasion will have an object of stats and information on the INSERT operation. One of the fields is insertId , which is the automatically assigned id of the new record in the database. We add this to the req.body object, and then call next() to pass control to the next handler, returnGameById . The handler returnGameById queries the database for the newly created object, using the id field we added to the req.body object in the first handler. In the callback for the query, queryResults , we return the database row as a JSON object, using the res.json method. To test this, commit and push the code up again to Code Capsules. git add . git commit -am 'added post route for games' git push origin Once it has successfully built and deployed on Code Capsules, we can try this new route out. To do this, download Postman , which is a tool that makes it easier to interact with APIs. Create a new query in Postman, with the HTTP method set to \"POST\". Set the URL to the URL of your Backend Capsule, along with the /games path. Then click the \"Body\" tab, select \"raw\" as the mime type, and select \"JSON\" from the dropdown as the content type. Add the following JSON payload to the body: { \"title\" : \"Super Mario Brothers\" , \"platform\" : \"NES\" , \"year\" : 1985 } Click \"Send\", and your API should send back the newly inserted game, along with its id : Adding an Update Route Now that we can add a game, and read back the catalogue, we might need to update an entry if we find an entry has a mistake. This is usually expressed as the HTTP PUT method . As a convention, the id of the document to update is passed in the URL path, and the updated document values are sent in the body. We'll use the same pattern as we did for the post route, and re-use the returnGameById function to retrieve the newly updated row from the database. Add this code to add the update route: router . put ( '/:id' , [ updateGame , returnGameById ]); function updateGame ( req , res , next ){ connection . query ( `UPDATE games SET title = ?, platform = ?, year = ? WHERE id = ?` , [ req . body . title , req . body . platform , req . body . year , req . params . id ], queryResults ); function queryResults ( err , results , fields ){ if ( err ) return next ( err ); req . body . id = req . params . id return next (); } } This code is very similar to the post route. The major difference being that we use the SQL UPDATE statement to update an existing row. Note that we get the id of the row to update from the req.params object. This object contains all the parameters passed and defined in the path. In the queryResults callback, we set the req.body.id field to the id from the params . This is so the next() handler can access the id of the updated record and retrieve the latest version from the database. Commit and push this code to deploy it to Code Capsules. Now you can test this route in Postman, by updating the HTTP method to put . Add the id 1 to the games path, and change some of the information in the body. Click \"Send\" and you should see the API return the updated document. Adding a Delete Route The last route we need to add is a delete route to remove a game entry. Luckily, HTTP has a DELETE method as part of its standard. The delete route will work similarly to our other routes. However, since we are removing a record, we don't need to return any data. We can just return the usual status code to signal everything worked OK. router . delete ( '/:id' , function ( req , res , next ){ connection . query ( `DELETE FROM games WHERE id = ?` , [ req . params . id ], queryResults ) function queryResults ( err , results , fields ){ if ( err ) return next ( err ); return res . sendStatus ( 200 ); } }); As in the update route, we expect the id of the record to delete to be provided by the client in the URL path. Then we run the SQL DELETE command, with the id from the path in req.params.id passed in to replace the single ? placeholder. Because we don't have any record to return (we deleted it!), we just return a status code 200 , which means everything worked OK. Great, it's time to commit this code, push it up and test it. You should be able select the \"DELETE\" verb in Postman, and add in a game id to the route. Click \"Send\", and you should see a blank reply, with the status code as 200 OK . Adding Authentication We've built a basic CRUD API, and we can do all the usual operations on it. However, anyone can access it. Let's add some authentication to take care of that issue. For this tutorial, we'll implement a very simple access control system, that only allows access to one pre-defined user. We'll use the HTTP Basic authentication scheme for this, implemented with the Passport package. Let's start by installing the two packages required. The first is the base Passport package, and the second is a package with the HTTP Basic authentication strategy. npm install passport passport-http Now we add this as middleware, to check credentials before our games routes are called. In the app.js file, add the following near the top of the file, just under the other package require statements: const passport = require ( 'passport' ); const BasicStrategy = require ( 'passport-http' ). BasicStrategy ; We'll need a place to store the user credentials, so we can check them against the credentials the client supplies. We can store them in the environment settings, as they'll be stored in plain text, i.e. unencrypted. In a production application, you would store them in the database, with the password hashed and salted. We'll leave that option as something for you to explore :). Head over to the \"Config\" page on your Backend Capsule, and add 2 new environment variables : USERNAME and PASSWORD . Supply values of your own to set your username and password, and click Update Capsule when you are done. Now we can add the Passport code to check incoming credentials against these stored credentials. Add this code just above the var gamesRouter = require('./routes/games'); line in app.js : passport . use ( new BasicStrategy ( function ( username , password , done ) { if ( username === process . env . USERNAME && password === process . env . PASSWORD ){ return done ( null , { username : process . env . USERNAME }); } else { return done ( null , false ); } }) ); This sets up Passport to use the \"basic\" strategy for authentication. We supply a callback function which checks the incoming credentials against the credentials in the environment variables. If they match, we call the Passport done() function, with the a simple user object containing the user name. If there is no match, we call the done() function with false to signal that we found no match for the user. The final part is to add the Passport authenticate middleware to the routes we want to protect. We'll add it to all our game routes. Update the line: app . use ( '/games' , [ gamesRouter ]); to: app . use ( '/games' , [ passport . authenticate ( 'basic' , { session : false }), gamesRouter ]); We set the session flag to false, as the convention for APIs is to require credentials to be passed with every request, i.e. no session cookies are used. Commit and push this updated code to deploy it. Once it is running, if you try any of the routes in Postman, you should see an authentication error message. To send the credentials along with your request, select the \"Authorisation\" tab in Postman. Choose \"Basic Auth\" from the dropdown list, and enter the credentials you set in the right-hand pane. If you try your query again, it should let you pass, and come back with the usual response. Next Steps Now that you've built an HTTP REST CRUD API, here are a couple more things to try: Add more routes. For example, you could add a review for each game. Try different authentication schemes. There are a lot on Passport to choose from. It could be interesting to implement an OAuth 2.0 scheme, as these are often used in production. Try adding validation to the routes, to ensure that the incoming data is in the correct format and has all the necessary fields.","title":"Game Catalogue API with Node.js and MySQL"},{"location":"tutorials/game-catalogue-with-nodejs-and-mysql/#building-a-game-catalogue-api","text":"APIs are a common way to expose data and information on the internet.

We'll create a very simple table with the following columns: id title system year We don't have direct access to the Data Capsule and the MySQL database it's running. We can only access the Data Capsule from our Backend Capsule. So, to make a new table, we'll create a setup script which we can direct the Backend Capsule to run. Create a new file called setup.js in the root of your project. Now we need to install a package that will allow us connect to MySQL and send commands. We'll use MySQL2 . Use npm from the terminal to install this package: npm install mysql2 Now we can add the code to create the table. In the new setup.js file, add the following code: const mysql = require ( 'mysql2' ); console . log ( 'Setting up Database....' ); const connection = mysql . createConnection ( process . env . DATABASE_URL ); console . log ( 'Creating tables...' ); connection . execute ( ` create table games ( id int auto_increment, title varchar(500) not null, platform varchar(500) not null, year int not null, constraint games_pk primary key (id) ); ` , function ( err , results , fields ){ if ( err ) { console . error ( err ); } console . log ( results ); }); This code imports the mysql2 driver package. We write a boot message to the console, just so we can see when the code runs in the logs. Then we can create a new connection to the database, using the connection string that was automatically added to the DATABASE_URL environment variable when we bound the capsules. Then we use the execute function to send a SQL command to the database. The SQL command creates a new table with the columns defined above. It has a callback to let us know if the operation is a success or if it has an error. In both cases, we write the output to the console, so we'll be able to see what happened when we read the logs. Now, we need a way for the Backend Capsule to run this setup script. We can use the package.json file to register a new command that npm will be able to run. Open the package.json file and add in the following line to the scripts object: \"setup\" : \"node setup.js\" The complete package.json file should look like this now: { \"name\" : \"game-api\" , \"version\" : \"0.0.0\" , \"private\" : true , \"scripts\" : { \"start\" : \"node ./bin/www\" , \"setup\" : \"node setup.js\" }, \"dependencies\" : { \"cookie-parser\" : \"~1.4.4\" , \"debug\" : \"~2.6.9\" , \"express\" : \"~4.16.1\" , \"morgan\" : \"~1.9.1\" , \"mysql2\" : \"^2.3.0\" } } We'll need to let our Backend Capsule know to run this script. Navigate to the \"Configure\" tab on the Backend Capsule, and scroll down to the \"Run Command\" section. Change this to: npm run setup Click \"Update Capsule\" to save this new setting. Let's commit the above code to the repo, and push it up so that Code Capsules can run it. Commit and push using the following commands in the terminal: git add . git commit -am 'added database setup script' git push origin If you navigate to the \"Logs\" tab on the Backend Capsule, you should see the script booting up and the result of the CREATE TABLE command.

Let's add some code to create an API route to read from this table. To keep the solution neater, we'll add a new file to contain the API route code. Add a new file called games.js in the routes folder in your project, with the following code: var express = require ( 'express' ); const mysql = require ( 'mysql2' ); var router = express . Router (); const connection = mysql . createConnection ( process . env . DATABASE_URL ); router . get ( '/' , function ( req , res , next ){ connection . query ( `SELECT * FROM games` , queryResults ); function queryResults ( err , results , fields ){ if ( err ) return next ( err ); return res . json ( results ); } }); module . exports = router ; This code imports the Express module so that we can construct a router , and the mysql2 module so that we can connect to the database. We create a router , which is an object that allows us to group routes and middleware together logically. We'll add all our CRUD routes to this router object. Then we create a new database connection, as we did in our setup script. Express routers allow us to add routes using the following structure: router . METHOD ( PATH , HANDLER ) METHOD is one of the standard HTTP request methods to use. PATH is the relative part of the server URL to get to the route, and HANDLER is a function that we want run when the route is accessed. To create the read route, we use the HTTP GET verb, which can be configured using the get method on the router. Since we need no parameters, we set the path to / . Then we add our handler function. The function accepts 3 arguments from the Express router: req , which is all the incoming request parameters and context from the client. res , a results object where we can specify how to return data to the client. next , a function that we can call to hand control to the next middleware in our route, if there is any. If we want to signal an error, we can pass an argument to next , and Express will return an error to the client with the data in that argument. In our get handler, we run a SQL query to select all entries from the database. The query method takes a SQL query and a callback function. This callback is called with the results or error from the SQL server. We use a separate named function as our callback. This is mainly a stylistic choice - we could write the function inline, but our code would be less readable, as it would have many indentations and creep to the right-hand side of the screen. In the callback, we check if the err , or error, parameter is set. If it is, we use the next function along with the error to exit the route early. This will send an error message to the client. If there is no error, we send the results of the SQL query back, formatted as JSON . Now that we have the router set up and our first route created, we can hook them up to the main Express app. Open the app.js file in the route folder and add the following code above the line var app = express(); : var gamesRouter = require ( './routes/games' ); This adds a reference to the router we defined in the game.js file. Now, let's use this reference to add the router to the Express app. Add the following line just above the module.exports = app; : app . use ( '/games' , [ gamesRouter ]); This mounts the route at the path /games on our server. Let's test all of this by committing and pushing these changes: git add . git commit -am 'added get route for games' git push origin If you visit the Code Capsules dashboard for the Backend Capsule, you should see a note that it's building. Once it's finished building, head over to your site in a browser and navigate to the /games route. You should see it return an empty array: This works, but is not very interesting!

For the create route, it would be nice to return the newly created entry, along with the id automatically created by MySQL for the entry. To do this, we'll first need to INSERT the new data into the database, and then run a SELECT command to retrieve the fully created database object. We can use the concept of \"middleware\" in Express to achieve this. Each route allows us to chain multiple handlers to it, with each handler running one after the other. This is the core concept of middleware. So to implement our create route with its two distinct operations, we can chain 2 handlers, like this: router . post ( '/' , [ functionOne , functionTwo ]) Here, functionOne can pass control to functionTwo by calling the next() parameter, which is passed into each handler by Express.

In this tutorial, we\u2019ll show you how to build a web application that creates images with rectangle graphics of different colors and sizes, and makes them available for download when requested by a user. Here's an example of a graphic image that can be created by the app we'll build: You can also add text to the generated images to create image covers and different marketing posts. Requirements You will need the following to complete the tutorial and host your application on Code Capsules: A Code Capsules account Git set up and installed, and a registered GitHub account IDE or text editor of your choice Python 3 installed Project Set Up To begin, we need to create a project folder to house all our files. In a terminal, navigate to the directory you'll be keeping the application files in. Run the commands below to create the project folder and navigate into it. mkdir generate-graphics cd generate-graphics Next we'll create a virtual environment , which will allow us to isolate the packages we need to run our application from the computer system. Run the command below from a terminal in the project root folder to create a virtual environment called env : python -m venv env To activate the virtual environment, run one of the following commands depending on your OS: MacOS source env/bin/activate Windows .\\env\\Scripts\\activate When you\u2019ve activated the virtual environment, the name env will appear on the far left of your current line. This confirms that the activation was successful. Now we can install dependencies our app needs to the environment. Run the command below from a terminal in the project root folder to install the packages we\u2019ll need: pip install flask pillow gunicorn Let's initialize a Git repository so that we can make use of version control throughout the course of this tutorial and keep track of our changes. Run the command git init to create a new empty repository in the project root folder. The final set up step is to link to GitHub . We'll link our newly created local git repository to a remote one that we can deploy to Code Capsules from. The remote repository can be thought of as a mirror image of the local one, and we'll update the remote repository when new code works as expected locally. Head over to GitHub and create a new repository. You\u2019ll be presented with instructions for linking your new remote repository to a local one. Go back to your terminal in the project root folder and run the command below, taking care to replace the username and repository_name with your own values. git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository_name.git Build the Frontend We can now start building our generative art app and we\u2019ll start with the frontend using Flask templates. Create an app/templates folder inside the project root folder and add a file named home.html to it. This file will contain the code for the landing page of our app. Populate it with the code below: <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < title > Generate Art without NFTs </ title > < link href = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\" rel = \"stylesheet\" integrity = \"sha384-giJF6kkoqNQ00vy+HMDP7azOuL0xtbfIcaT9wjKHr8RbDVddVHyTfAAsrekwKmP1\" crossorigin = \"anonymous\" /> <!-- HTMX --> < script src = \"https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.5.0\" ></ script > < style > body { padding : 20 px ; text-align : center ; } img { max-height : 75 vh ; } . image-frame { border : 10 px solid #213e49 ; border-radius : 5 px ; width : 80 vh ; margin : auto ; margin-top : 20 px ; } . button-row { display : flex ; flex-direction : row ; justify-content : space-around ; width : 60 % ; margin : auto ; margin-top : 25 px ; } </ style > </ head > <!-- Insert body code here --> </ html > The <link> tag in the <head> section links to Bootstrap to simplify styling for common HTML elements like forms and buttons, while the <style> tag adds any extra unique styling we might need. We\u2019ll be using HTMx to send requests to generate a new graphic image, and we include it in the project by adding the <script> tag below the <link> tag. HTMx makes it possible to add interactivity to traditional multipage HTML sites without any of the extra complexity that\u2019s introduced by popular single page frameworks. Next, we'll add the code for the body of the home page. Copy and paste the snippet below underneath the closing </head> tag in home.html : < body > < h1 > Generate Art </ h1 > < p > The art below is unique. It will never be seen again if you press \"I hate this art, make me another\". If you like it, you can download it and keep it. No need to get blockchain or NFTs or Open Sea involved: just a few lines of Python. Read our < a href = \"https://codecapsules.io/docs/tutorials/generative-art-python.html\" > tutorial on how to make your own </ a > . </ p > {% if image %} < div class = \"image-frame\" > < img id = \"new-image\" src = \"data:image/png;base64,{{image}}\" /> </ div > {% endif %} < div class = \"button-row\" > {% if image %} < form action = \"/download\" method = \"post\" enctype = \"multipart/form-data\" > < input type = \"text\" name = \"image\" value = {{image}} style = \"display: none;\" /> < button type = \"submit\" class = \"btn btn-primary\" > Download </ button > </ form > {% endif %} < button class = \"btn btn-primary\" hx-target = \"#new-image\" hx-get = \"/generate-another\" hx-swap = \"outerHTML\" > I hate this art, make me another </ button > </ div > </ body > Our app has two main features: it allows a user to generate new graphic images and to download them. The \u201cI hate this art, make me another\u201d button sends a request to the /generate-another route, which handles the creation of a new graphic image. When the app generates an image a user likes, the user can download that image by pressing the \u201cDownload\u201d button. This sends a request to the /download route which is responsible for starting the image download. The <img> tag below the page header takes in a Base64 string as input and renders the corresponding graphic image to the screen. We\u2019ve assigned an id value of \u201cnew-image\u201d to the tag to allow us to use HTMx to update the image when a user clicks the \u201cI hate this art, make me another\u201d button. You\u2019ll notice three HTMx attributes in the button's src code, which is located at the bottom of the page. Let\u2019s go over them and see what each one is responsible for: hx-target : This attribute accepts an id value prefixed by a # . It lets HTMx know which element to swap on a successful request. hx-get : The hx-get attribute sends a GET request to the specified URL. If we wanted to send a POST request, we would have used the hx-post attribute instead. hx-swap : This attribute tells HTMx how to swap out the old with the new elements after a successful request. In our case we\u2019ve used the value of \u201couterHTML\u201d to specify that the entire <img> element be replaced by the response. Other accepted values include but are not limited to innerHTML , beforeend , and afterend . You can view other HTMx attributes and their functionalities in this HTMx reference guide . Build the Backend The backend contains the interesting bits of our app\u2019s logic. Here, we will see the logic for the two routes that are called in the frontend. Create a file named run.py in the project root folder and populate it with the code below: from app import app if __name__ == \"__main__\" : app . run () The code above is responsible for starting our application by calling Flask\u2019s run method. Initialize app Module Let\u2019s go ahead and initialize the app module we imported in the previous code snippet. Create an __init__.py file inside the /app folder and populate it with the code below: from flask import Flask app = Flask ( __name__ ) from app import views In the code above, we create a Flask app object and import the app views we\u2019ll add later on. Add Graphic Image Generation Logic The next step is to add logic for the graphic image generation. Create a file named palettes.json in the project root folder and populate it with the code in this file . This is a list of 2D arrays containing random numbers that represent different color palettes. We sourced these color palettes from Color-Hex . Our app will pick randomly from these each time a user chooses to generate a new image. Next, let\u2019s create the file that will make use of the palettes we defined. In the /app folder, add a file named make_squares.py and populate it with the code below: import base64 import json import random import io from PIL import Image , ImageDraw BLACK = ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 255 ) palettes = [] with open ( \"palettes.json\" ) as f : ps = json . load ( f ) for p in ps : palette = [ tuple ( x ) for x in p ] palettes . append ( palette ) def create ( save_path ): img = Image . new ( \"RGBA\" , ( 1000 , 1000 ), ( 255 , 255 , 255 , 255 )) d = ImageDraw . Draw ( img ) num_recs = random . randrange ( 20 , 40 ) min_size = random . randrange ( 20 , 50 ) max_size = min_size + random . randrange ( 20 , 100 ) colors = random . choice ( palettes ) stroke_width = random . randrange ( 1 , 5 ) xoffset = 0 yoffset = 0 for row in range ( num_recs ): for rec in range ( num_recs ): topleftx = random . randrange ( 0 , 50 ) + xoffset toplefty = random . randrange ( 0 , 50 ) + yoffset bottomrightx = topleftx + random . randrange ( min_size , max_size ) bottomrighty = toplefty + random . randrange ( min_size , max_size ) color = random . choice ( colors ) xoffset += 50 r = d . rectangle ( [ topleftx , toplefty , bottomrightx , bottomrighty ], fill = color , outline = BLACK , width = stroke_width , ) yoffset += 50 xoffset = 0 img . save ( save_path ) image = io . BytesIO () img . save ( image , \"PNG\" ) image . seek ( 0 ) img_b64 = base64 . b64encode ( image . getvalue ()) . decode () return img_b64 The module defined in the code snippet above leverages the Pillow package to create new random images using the palettes we defined in the palettes.json file. In lines 10-15, we open the palettes.json file and add its contents to a local array named palettes that we\u2019ll use in the create() method. The create() method is responsible for generating Base64 image strings for new random images. It does so by first creating a blank canvas and adding a random number of rectangles of different sizes and colours. When the image has been created, it\u2019s returned as a Base64 image string, which is more efficient to transfer between our app modules. Add App Views The last step in building our backend is to add the application views. To do this, create a file named views.py inside the /app folder and populate it with the code below: from app import app from flask import render_template , send_file , request from app.make_squares import create import io , base64 from PIL import Image import os tmp_file_path = \"/tmp/imgnew.png\" @app . route ( \"/\" , methods = [ \"GET\" ]) def index (): graphic_image = create ( tmp_file_path ) return render_template ( \"home.html\" , image = graphic_image ) @app . route ( \"/generate-another\" , methods = [ \"GET\" ]) def generate_another (): graphic_image = create ( tmp_file_path ) response = f \"\"\" <img id=\"new-image\" src=\"data:image/png;base64, { graphic_image } \" /> \"\"\" return response @app . route ( \"/download\" , methods = [ \"GET\" , \"POST\" ]) def download (): return send_file ( tmp_file_path , mimetype = \"image/png\" , as_attachment = True , download_name = \"graphic.png\" , ) At the top of the file, we import the create method from the make_squares module, since our views need to return the Base64 image string when responding. The index route is called when the app is first started, and it calls the create() method to generate a Base64 image string and returns it in the home.html template. The /generate-another route is called when a user clicks on the \u201cI hate this art, make me another\u201d button. It saves the new graphic image to the /tmp folder before returning it as part of an HTML response, since the request is triggered by HTMx. This allows our app to only refresh the image element and not the whole page, like in the case of rendering templates. The last view we have is for the download feature. When a user clicks on the \u201cDownload\u201d button, the /download route is called and it gets the most recently generated graphic image from the file storage before returning a response with the file added as an attachment. Prepare for Deployment Our generate art app is now complete and we are only left with adding the files necessary for deployment before we can publish it. Add Procfile and requirements.txt We\u2019ll start by creating a Procfile, which tells Code Capsules how to run our app. Create a file named Procfile in the project root folder and add the following code to it: web: gunicorn run:app We use the gunicorn server to run our app in production, since the built-in Flask server is less secure and only suitable to be used in a development environment. Next, we need to generate a requirements.txt file to tell Code Capsules which packages need to be installed first before our app can start. Run the command below from a terminal while in the project\u2019s root folder to create a requirements.txt file. pip freeze \u2013local > requirements.txt Add Virtual Environment to .gitignore Before we push our local changes to the remote repository, we need to stop tracking our virtual environment folder. Create a file named .gitignore in the project root folder and add the code below to it: /env Add, Commit, and Push Git Changes Let's add and commit all the files we created to our local repository and then push them to the remote one. Do this by running the commands listed below in a terminal while in the project\u2019s root folder: git add -A git commit -m \"Added generative graphics files\" git push -u origin main Your remote repository will now be up to date with your local one. Deploy to Code Capsules The final step is to deploy our app. Log into your Code Capsules account and link your remote GitHub repository to Code Capsules. Create a Backend Capsule and deploy the app there. You can follow this deployment guide to see how to do this in greater detail. That\u2019s it!

You need to choose a server's operating system, maintain and update the server, and figure out where to host the server itself. In this tutorial, we'll work with an alternative to the traditional method of hosting a front-end (content that visitors see when they load your website), called Code Capsules . Code Capsules is a service that hosts front-end (and back-end) code online. Furthermore, Code Capsules: Manages all of the technical details \u2013 no server management required. Integrates with GitHub to deploy your code with a single git push . First, we'll take a look at choosing a portfolio template and personalising it. After, we'll push the portfolio to a GitHub repository and see how Code Capsules connects to GitHub and makes your portfolio visible to the world. Requirements & Prerequisite Knowledge Hosting a portfolio on Code Capsules requires no previous knowledge about servers or front-end development. To personalise a portfolio template and deploy it to Code Capsules, we'll need: A text editor, such as Sublime Text , or VSCode . A registered GitHub account. The Git command-line interface installed. Creating a Portfolio HTML5 UP provides HTML site templates for free. We'll use the Massively template \u2013 an easy to modify and elegant HTML template. Follow these instructions carefully : Download the Massively template. Create a directory somewhere on your computer, then enter it. Within this directory, create another directory, and extract the Massively template files into it . This last step is necessary for hosting a web-page on Code Capsules. The file structure should look something like this: myPortfolio portFolder + assets + images + generic.html + elements.html + index.html The index.html file contains all of the HTML code for our portfolio \u2013 any changes to this code will result in a change to the portfolio. To view changes you make as we begin to modify the template, double click the index.html file to open the portfolio in a web-browser. Personalizing the Template This tutorial will following the creation of a portfolio for Abraham Lincoln \u2013 the 16th president of the USA. We'll take a closer look at some things Abraham Lincoln wouldn't want in a portfolio \u2013 and maybe you too. The next few sections will cover how to modify the following elements of the portfolio template: Any not personalized text. The \"Generic Page\" and \"Elements Reference\" tabs. Pagination. The email contact form. Personal information (address, social media account). Let's start with the title and subheading of the portfolio. Open the index.html file in your text editor. You'll see the following block of HTML near the top of the file: < head > < title > Massively by HTML5 UP </ title > < meta charset = \"utf-8\" /> < meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no\" /> < link rel = \"stylesheet\" href = \"assets/css/main.css\" /> < noscript >< link rel = \"stylesheet\" href = \"assets/css/noscript.css\" /></ noscript > </ head > Change the text within the <title> tags to whatever you'd like, such as: \"Abraham Lincoln\". This is what will appear in search engines and browser tabs. Now we'll change the text that displays at the top of the portfolio. Scroll down in your text editor, until you see the following code: <!-- Intro --> < div id = \"intro\" > < h1 > This is < br /> Massively </ h1 > < p > A free, fully responsive HTML5 + CSS3 site template designed by < a href = \"https://twitter.com/ajlkn\" > @ajlkn </ a > for < a href = \"https://html5up.net\" > HTML5 UP </ a >< br /> and released for free under the < a href = \"https://html5up.net/license\" > Creative Commons license </ a > . </ p > < ul class = \"actions\" > < li >< a href = \"#header\" class = \"button icon solid solo fa-arrow-down scrolly\" > Continue </ a ></ li > </ ul > </ div > <!-- Header --> < header id = \"header\" > < a href = \"index.html\" class = \"logo\" > Massively </ a > </ header > Customise the words wrapped in the <h1>...</h1> tags \u2013 this is the large text that displays at the top of the portfolio. Change the text within the <p>...</p> tags to edit the subheading of the portfolio \u2013 the <br /> tags and the <a>...</a> tags are safe to delete. Delete the \"Massively\" button that appears as you scroll down the portfolio by deleting the three lines under the <!-- Header --> text wrapped in <header>...</header> tags. Save the file and open it in a web browser. Our portfolio should now look something like this: Next, we'll take a look at deleting the date entries above each portfolio piece, removing the \"Generic Page\" and \"Elements Reference\" tabs, and modifying the social media links. Removing the tabs, dates, and links The default layout for Massively is designed for a blog or news website containing articles. To look like a portfolio, we should delete the dates above each article entry. Do so by locating and deleting all lines beginning with <span class=\"date\"...> . To make this a single-page portfolio, we can delete the \"Generic Page\" and \"Elements Reference\" tabs by finding: < li class = \"active\" >< a href = \"index.html\" > This is Massively </ a ></ li > < li >< a href = \"generic.html\" > Generic Page </ a ></ li > < li >< a href = \"elements.html\" > Elements Reference </ a ></ li > and deleting the last two lines. While we're at it, alter the title of the main tab by changing the \"This is Massively\" text. The code for social media accounts is located at the top and bottom of the index.html file. Starting at the top, find this block of code: < ul class = \"icons\" > < li >< a href = \"#\" class = \"icon brands fa-twitter\" >< span class = \"label\" > Twitter </ span ></ a ></ li > < li >< a href = \"#\" class = \"icon brands fa-facebook-f\" >< span class = \"label\" > Facebook </ span ></ a ></ li > < li >< a href = \"#\" class = \"icon brands fa-instagram\" >< span class = \"label\" > Instagram </ span ></ a ></ li > < li >< a href = \"#\" class = \"icon brands fa-github\" >< span class = \"label\" > GitHub </ span ></ a ></ li > </ ul > Delete any social media account you don't need \u2013 Abraham Lincoln doesn't have Instagram, so he would delete the following line to remove the Instagram link: < li >< a href = \"#\" class = \"icon brands fa-instagram\" >< span class = \"label\" > Instagram </ span ></ a ></ li > If you'd like to link your social media accounts, enter the account link in place of the # in href=\"#\" . For example, to link Abraham Lincoln's Twitter account, you'd edit the Twitter line like so: < li >< a href = \"https://twitter.com/Abe_Lincoln\" class = \"icon brands fa-twitter\" >< span class = \"label\" > Twitter </ span ></ a ></ li > The social media code at the bottom of the index.html is nearly identical \u2013 follow this same process to edit the code at the bottom. Removing unnecessary content and further personalisation In this section we'll: Remove the contact form Remove pagination Update or remove contact information 1.Remove the contact form found at the bottom of the portfolio by deleting the following code: < section > < form method = \"post\" action = \"#\" > < div class = \"fields\" > < div class = \"field\" > < label for = \"name\" > Name </ label > < input type = \"text\" name = \"name\" id = \"name\" /> </ div > < div class = \"field\" > < label for = \"email\" > Email </ label > < input type = \"text\" name = \"email\" id = \"email\" /> </ div > < div class = \"field\" > < label for = \"message\" > Message </ label > < textarea name = \"message\" id = \"message\" rows = \"3\" ></ textarea > </ div > </ div > < ul class = \"actions\" > < li >< input type = \"submit\" value = \"Send Message\" /></ li > </ ul > </ form > </ section > 2.Remove pagination by deleting: < footer > < div class = \"pagination\" > <!--<a href=\"#\" class=\"previous\">Prev</a>--> < a href = \"#\" class = \"page active\" > 1 </ a > < a href = \"#\" class = \"page\" > 2 </ a > < a href = \"#\" class = \"page\" > 3 </ a > < span class = \"extra\" > &hellip; </ span > < a href = \"#\" class = \"page\" > 8 </ a > < a href = \"#\" class = \"page\" > 9 </ a > < a href = \"#\" class = \"page\" > 10 </ a > < a href = \"#\" class = \"next\" > Next </ a > </ div > </ footer > 3.To delete specific contact information sections (the address section is shown below), delete the <section> tag, the information you want to delete, and the corresponding </section> tag. < section class = \"alt\" > < h3 > Address </ h3 > < p > 1234 Somewhere Road #87257 < br /> Nashville, TN 00000-0000 </ p > </ section > If you'd like to personalise your contact information instead, edit the text within the <h3>...</h3> tags and the <p>...</p> tags. Personalising portfolio pieces Our portfolio is almost complete \u2013 we just need to personalise the actual portfolio pieces \u2013 customising the images, button links, and other text. Let's start with the images. Gather any images you'd like to replace with the default images. Then, place your images in the images directory, located in the same directory as the index.html file. You can swap images by finding lines wrapped in <img.../> tags, like the below line. < img src = \"images/pic01.jpg\" alt = \"\" /> images is the name of the directory where you placed your image. To change the image, replace the text \"pic01.jpg\" with the name and file extension of your desired image. Once we've replaced the images, we should change the text for each portfolio entry. Find code blocks wrapped in <article>...</article> tags, such as: < article > < header > < h2 >< a href = \"#\" > Sed magna < br /> ipsum faucibus </ a ></ h2 > </ header > < a href = \"#\" class = \"image fit\" >< img src = \"images/pic02.jpg\" alt = \"\" /></ a > < p > Donec eget ex magna. Interdum et malesuada fames ac ante ipsum primis in faucibus. Pellentesque venenatis dolor imperdiet dolor mattis sagittis magna etiam. </ p > < ul class = \"actions special\" > < li >< a href = \"#\" class = \"button\" > Full Story </ a ></ li > </ ul > </ article > You can: Change the entry's title by editing the text within the <h2>...</h2> tags. Personalise the entry text by editing the Latin wrapped in the <p>...</p> tags. Customise buttons by finding the <li><a href=\"#\" class=\"button\">Full Story</a></li> lines and replacing the \"#\" with a link to your portfolio piece. Replace \"Full Story\" text with something more appropriate. If you would like to remove a portfolio piece, delete the <article>...</article> tags and all the text wrapped in the tags. Once finished with the portfolio, we need to push it to GitHub. After, the portfolio can be deployed to Code Capsules, making the portfolio publicly viewable. Uploading to GitHub If you already know how to push code from a local repository to a remote repository on GitHub, push the sub-directory containing the portfolio to GitHub and skip to the next section. Otherwise, we'll push (or send) our portfolio code to a GitHub remote repository (a place where your code stores on GitHub). Once complete, Code Capsules can connect to the repository and automatically \"deploy\" the portfolio online. Let's create the remote repository now. Creating the remote repository Follow the steps below to create a remote repository on GitHub: Go to www.github.com and log in. Find the \"Create new repository\" button and click it. Name your repository anything (in this picture it was named \"myPortfolio\"). Copy the URL given to you under \"Quick setup\". Locate the link to your repository under \"Quick Setup\" Sending files to the GitHub repository We've created the remote repository \u2013 now we need to push the portfolio to GitHub. Open a terminal and navigate to the top-level directory containing the portfolio. This directory should contain the sub-directory that has all the portfolio files. If your file structure looked like: myPortfolio portFolder + assets + images + generic.html + elements.html + index.html You would open the terminal in the myPortfolio directory. Not the portFolder directory. Enter each command in order: git init git add . git commit -m \"First commit!\" git branch -M main git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepositoryname.git git push -u origin main Replace the URL above with the URL to your remote repository (copied in the previous section). Now you can see the portfolio code in your GitHub repository. Your repository should look similar to the below, where all of your portfolio code is contained in a sub-directory (in this image, the sub-directory is \"portFolder\"): Now Code Capsules can host the portfolio. Deploying to Code Capsules To deploy the portfolio to Code Capsules, navigate to https://codecapsules.io/, create an account, and log in. After logging in, you'll be greeted with a page that looks like the below. Notice the \"Team Personal\" at the top left. Every new account starts with a \"Team Personal\". Code Capsules provides Teams for collaborative development \u2013 you can invite other people to your Team and Team members can view and edit your web-applications. You can create other teams - but the default \"Personal\" team is fine for now. At the center, you'll see a clickable box, labeled \"Personal\". This is called a Space . Spaces act as a further layer of organisation. Spaces can contain one or many Capsules (more on Capsules shortly) and can help organise large projects. We'll take a look at this space soon, but we first need to link Code Capsules to Github. Linking the repository We need to give Code Capsules access to our portfolio. Click on your profile image at the top right of the screen, then find the \"GitHub\" button \u2013 click on it. Code Capsules will redirect you to GitHub. Then: Log in to GitHub. Click your username. Press \"Only select repositories\". From the drop-down menu, type the repository's name containing your portfolio and select it. Press \"Install & Authorize\". Now we can deploy our portfolio. Return back to your Team, and enter the space labeled \"Personal\" Creating Capsule, and viewing the portfolio The last step to deploying the Portfolio is creating a Capsule . Capsules provide the server for your application or code \u2013 in our case, we'll create a Capsule that'll host our portfolio. Click \"Create a new Capsule for your Space\". You'll be prompted to choose a Capsule type \u2013 our portfolio contains only front-end code, so choose a \"Frontend\" Capsule and: Select the \"Trial\" product type. Click the repository containing the portfolio. Press \"Next\". Leave the build command blank and enter the name of the sub-directory containing the portfolio files in the \"Static Content Folder Path\" entry box. Press \"Create Capsule\". Your Capsule is now building. This process will make your portfolio visible online. After it has deployed, click the \"Overview\" tab, then press the link under \"Domains\" to view your portfolio. Conclusion and Further Reading We've created a portfolio, pushed it to GitHub, and made the portfolio visible to the world. In the future, we'll take a look at \"Backend\" capsules. These \"Backend\" capsules will enable us to host back-end code and provide additional functionality \u2013 like implementing the contact form we removed at the beginning of the tutorial. We'll also take a look at customising your domain, so people can view your portfolio by typing something like https://www.myportfolio.co.za If any of the HTML code was confusing, or you'd like to learn more for further customisation, check out this tutorial written by Mozilla.

The next step is building a working backend, or making your web application functional. Buttons are nice to have, but it's more interesting to have those buttons do something. That's what we'll focus on today. Through a step-by-step process, we'll develop this functionality. We'll use Flask and a frontend template to create a web application that allows users to buy products through Stripe Checkout (a tool for creating a \"checkout\" process for products) and subscribe to an email list with help from the Mailgun email API service. Then, we'll host the web application on Code Capsules so people around the world can buy your product and subscribe to your mailing list. Requirements To successfully complete this project, we'll need: A text editor (like Sublime or VSCode ) installed. Python 3.XX+ installed. Virtualenv installed. Git installed and a GitHub account. A Code Capsules account. Setting Up the Frontend We'll use the Laurel frontend template from https://cruip.com to add our functionality. This template is perfect for our project \u2013 there is already an email subscription box that just needs to be implemented and, with a few modifications, we'll implement a \"Buy Now\" button. After downloading the Laurel template: Create a directory named project . Within the project directory, create a sub-directory named templates . Open the downloaded template and extract the files within the laurel directory into the templates subdirectory. You can view the template by opening the index.html file in the templates subdirectory. We'll change the first \"Early access\" button to \"Buy Now\" and implement Stripe Checkout functionality for it. Then we'll change the second \"Early access\" button at the bottom of the template to \"Subscribe\", and implement the email subscription functionality for it. First, let's change the \"Early access\" button texts. Modifying the \"Early access\" text We'll start with changing the first \"Early access\" button to \"Buy Now\". Open the index.html file in a text editor. Find this line: < div class = \"hero-cta\" >< a class = \"button button-shadow\" href = \"#\" > Learn more </ a >< a class = \"button button-primary button-shadow\" href = \"#\" > Early access </ a ></ div > Replace it with: < div class = \"hero-cta\" > < a class = \"button button-shadow\" href = \"#\" > Learn more </ a > < a id = \"checkout-button\" class = \"button button-primary button-shadow\" href = \"#\" > Buy Now </ a > </ div > As well as changing \"Early access\" to \"Buy Now\", we've added [SOMETHING?], and given it an ID with id=\"checkout-button\" . This will be useful when implementing Stripe Checkout. Next, find this line: < a class = \"button button-primary button-block button-shadow\" href = \"#\" > Early access </ a > Replace \"Early access\" with \"Subscribe\". View the changes by saving the index.html file and re-opening it in a web browser. We have one more task before building our Flask backend. Project directory restructuring To make a functional web application out of our template, Flask requires a specific directory structure, so we will need to reorganise the project directory. To do this: Create a new directory named static in the project directory. Navigate to the templates directory and then the dist directory. Copy all of the directories located in dist into the static directory that we created above. Your project file structure should look like this: project static css + style.css images + iphone-mockup.png js + main.min.js templates This was necessary because Flask strictly serves CSS, JavaScript, and images from the static directory, and renders HTML files in the templates directory. Because we've moved our template's files around, we now need to edit our index.html file to point to their new locations. Flask uses the Jinja templating library to allow us to embed backend code in HTML. This code will be executed on the webserver before a given page is served to the user, allowing us to give that page dynamic functionality and make it responsive to user input. The first thing we will use Jinja templating for is to dynamically locate and load our index.html file's stylesheet. Open the index.html file in the templates folder and find this line: < link rel = \"stylesheet\" href = \"dist/css/style.css\" > Replace the value of href with the string below. < link rel = \"stylesheet\" href = \"{{url_for('static',filename='css/style.css')}}\" > In Jinja, anything between {{ and }} is server-side code that will be evaluated before the page is served to users, i.e. when it is rendered . In this way, we can include the output of Python functions and the values of Python variables in our HTML. Jinja syntax is similar to Python, but not identical. In the Jinja code above, we're calling the function url_for() , which asks Flask to find the location of our style.css file in our static directory. Speaking of Flask, we're almost ready to implement our functionality. Setting Up the Virtual Environment We'll create a virtual environment for our project. The virtual environment will be useful later on when we host our web application on Code Capsules, as it will ensure that the Python libraries we use for development are installed in the Capsule. To create a virtual environment, navigate to the project directory in a terminal and enter virtualenv env . Activate the virtual environment with: Linux/MacOSX : source env/bin/activate Windows : \\env\\Scripts\\activate.bat If the virtual environment has activated correctly, you'll notice (env) to the left of your name in the terminal. Keep this terminal open \u2013 we'll install the project requirements next. Installing the requirements For our project, we'll use the following libraries: Flask is a lightweight Python web development framework. Gunicorn is the WSGI server we'll use to host our application on Code Capsules. Requests is a Python library that allows us to send HTTP requests . Stripe is another Python library that will help us interact with the Stripe API . Install these by entering the command below in the virtual environment. pip3 install flask gunicorn requests stripe Now we can build the backend for our web application. Creating the Flask Application In the projects folder, create a new file named app.py . This file will contain all of our Flask code. Open the app.py file in a text editor and enter the following: from flask import Flask , render_template , request import requests , stripe app = Flask ( __name__ ) @app . route ( \"/\" , methods = [ \"GET\" , \"POST\" ]) def index (): return render_template ( \"index.html\" ) if __name__ == '__main__' : app . run ( debug = True ) We import the following functions from flask : Flask , which provides the Flask application object. render_template() , which will render our index.html file. request , an object which contains any information sent to our web application \u2013 later this will be used to retrieve the email address entered in our subscription box. Be careful not to confuse this with the requests library. The index function has a route decorator which causes it to execute when Flask receives an HTTP GET or POST request for the \"/\" URL, i.e. when someone navigates to the website's domain or IP address in a browser. When render_template(\"index.html\") runs, Flask will look in the templates directory for a file named index.html and render it by executing its Jinja template code and serving the resulting HTML. To see this, run app.py with flask run in your terminal. Open the provided IP address in your browser \u2013 the web application should look like this: Let's make this web application useful and implement the first bit of functionality \u2013 the email list feature. Signing up for Mailgun We'll use Mailgun to handle our email subscriber list. Mailgun is free up to 5,000 emails per month. Register with Mailgun and continue. With an account registered, create a mailing list by doing the following: Log in to Mailgun. Click \"Sending\" then \"Mailing lists\" on the dashboard. At the top right, click \"Create mailing list\". Enter whatever you'd like for the address prefix, name, and description \u2013 leave everything else default. Click \"Add mailing list\". Navigate to the mailing list we just created. You'll see something called an alias address \u2013 Mailgun provides every new mailing list with one. When you send an email to your alias address, Mailgun sends a copy of the email to everyone who is subscribed to your mailing list. Jot down your alias address, we'll use it soon. Next, you'll need to retrieve the API key for your Mailgun account. We'll use this API key in our web application to validate your Mailgun account when people subscribe to your mailing list. Find the API key by clicking on your account at the top right of the screen. Click \"API keys\", and make a note of your private API key. Implementing the Subscribe Button With the mailing list created, we can implement the subscribe button. Re-open the index.html file. At the bottom of the file, find the line: < section class = \"newsletter section\" > From the above line down to its corresponding </section> tag, replace all of the markup with the following: < section class = \"newsletter section\" > < div class = \"container-sm\" > < div class = \"newsletter-inner section-inner\" > < div class = \"newsletter-header text-center\" > < h2 class = \"section-title mt-0\" > Stay in the know </ h2 > < p class = \"section-paragraph\" > Lorem ipsum is common placeholder text used to demonstrate the graphic elements of a document or visual presentation. </ p > </ div > < form method = \"POST\" > < div class = \"footer-form newsletter-form field field-grouped\" > < div class = \"control control-expanded\" > < input class = \"input\" type = \"email\" name = \"email\" placeholder = \"Your best email&hellip;\" > </ div > < div class = \"control\" > < button class = \"button button-primary button-block button-shadow\" type = \"submit\" > Subscribe </ a > </ div > </ div > </ form > </ div > </ div > </ section > The important part of this HTML for our functionality is the form tag. Let's take a closer look at it. < form method = \"POST\" > < div class = \"footer-form newsletter-form field field-grouped\" > < div class = \"control control-expanded\" > < input class = \"input\" type = \"email\" name = \"email\" placeholder = \"Your best email&hellip;\" > </ div > < div class = \"control\" > < button class = \"button button-primary button-block button-shadow\" type = \"submit\" > Subscribe </ a > </ div > </ div > </ form > This contains one input , for the user's email address, and a button for submitting that email address. When the user clicks on the button, an HTTP request will be sent from their browser to our Flask backend, containing the email address. As per the method attribute of the form tag, this will be a [POST request. Recall that the Python code we entered in the last section provided for both GET and POST HTTP requests. As submitting this form will also send a request to \"/\", we can differentiate between a user browsing to our website ( GET ) and subscribing to our mailing list ( POST ) by looking at the HTTP method. We'll do that in the next section. Subscribe functionality in Flask Return to the app.py file. Find this line: @app . route ( \"/\" , methods [ \"GET\" , \"POST\" ]) Just above it, enter this code: def subscribe ( user_email , email_list , api_key ): return requests . post ( \"https://api.mailgun.net/v3/lists/\" + email_list + \"/members\" , auth = ( 'api' , api_key ), data = { 'subscribed' : True , 'address' : user_email ,}) This function is called when a user clicks the \"Subscribe\" button. It takes three arguments: user_email : The email the user has entered. email_list : Your Mailgun alias address. api_key : Your Mailgun secret API key. The real logic is contained in the return line. Here, we use requests.post() to add the user_email to our email_list , by sending (or \"posting\") all of the values in data to Mailgun's email list API . Next, modify the current index() function like below, replacing MAILGUN_ALIAS and YOUR-MAILGUN-PRIVATE-KEY with the email alias and private API key we previously retrieved: @app . route ( \"/\" , methods [ \"GET\" , \"POST\" ]) def index (): if request . method == \"POST\" : user_email = request . form . get ( 'email' ) response = subscribe ( user_email , 'MAILGUN_ALIAS' , 'YOUR-MAILGUN-PRIVATE-KEY' ) return render_template ( \"index.html\" ) In the previous section , we added the POST method to the subscribe button. We will therefor know when someone has clicked the subscribe button with the line: if request . method == \"POST\" : If they've clicked the subscribe button, we obtain the email they entered by referencing the relevant input field's name attribute in request.form.get , and adding the email to the mailing list our subscribe method. Try it out: enter an email address and hit \"Subscribe\". Navigate back to the \"Mailing lists\" tab on Mailgun and click on the list we created. You will find the email address you just submitted under \"Recipients\". All that's left is to add functionality to our \"Buy Now\" button. Implementing \"Buy Now\" with Stripe Checkout Stripe Checkout allows business owners to accept payments on their web applications. Let's create an account . After creating an account, log in and find your API keys by clicking \"Developers\" then \"API keys\" on the dashboard. Here we'll see two API keys \u2013 a publishable API key, and a secret API key. You can think of these as a username and password. Stripe uses the publishable API key to identify your account, and the secret API key to ensure it's really you using it. Open the app.py file. Above the subscribe function, add the following lines, replacing YOUR PUBLISHABLE KEY HERE and YOUR SECRET KEY HERE appropriately: app . config [ 'STRIPE_PUBLISH_KEY' ] = 'YOUR PUBLISHABLE KEY HERE' app . config [ 'STRIPE_SECRET_KEY' ] = 'YOUR SECRET KEY HERE' stripe . api_key = app . config [ 'STRIPE_SECRET_KEY' ] In thid code, we place the two Stripe keys in our Flask app's configuration settings for ease of access, then set our Stripe secret API key. These are test API keys that we'll use to check out our product. With these keys, no charges will be incurred when making payments. However, before we can make a payment, we need a product, so let's create one. Return to Stripe, log in, and navigate to the \"Products\" tab on the dashboard. Creating a product Create a product by doing the following: Click \"Add product\" on the top right. Name the product. Add a description and price. Choose \"One time\" payment. Click \"Save product\" After the last step, save the API key found in the \"Pricing\" section. We'll use this API key to tell Stripe which product we want our customers to pay for. Adding functionality in Flask Time to create the \"Buy Now\" button logic. Open app.py again and modify the index function accordingly. Replace \"YOUR-PRICE-API-KEY\" with the API key for your product, that we saved in the previous section. @app . route ( \"/\" , methods = [ \"GET\" , \"POST\" ]) def index (): session = stripe . checkout . Session . create ( payment_method_types = [ 'card' ], mode = 'payment' , success_url = 'https://example.com/success' , cancel_url = 'https://example.com/cancel' , line_items = [{ 'price' : 'YOUR-PRICE-API-KEY' , 'quantity' : 1 , }] ) if request . method == \"POST\" : user_email = request . form . get ( 'email' ) response = subscribe ( user_email , 'MAILGUN_ALIAS' , 'YOUR-MAILGUN-PRIVATE-KEY' ) return render_template ( \"index.html\" , checkout_id = session [ 'id' ], checkout_pk = app . config [ 'STRIPE_PK' ], ) We use the stripe library to create a new \"Session\" object. This object contains multiple variables affecting how our customers interact with the \"Buy Now\" button. For more information on these variables, see Stripe's documentation . We also return two new variables \u2013 checkout_id and checkout_pk . checkout_id , which we get from Stripe, stores information about the potential purchase (price, payment type, etc). checkout_pk stores our private API key, which we added to the Flask app's configuration settings above. When a customer buys our product, their money is sent to the account associated with this private API key. Let's see how our HTML will use these new variables and redirect us to the Stripe Checkout page. \"Buy Now\" button functionality in the HTML file With our Flask logic finished, we can implement the \"Buy Now\" button functionality in our index.html file. Open the index.html and find this section: < div class = \"hero-copy\" > < h1 class = \"hero-title mt-0\" > Landing template for startups </ h1 > < p class = \"hero-paragraph\" > Our landing page template works on all devices, so you only have to set it up once, and get beautiful results forever. </ p > < div class = \"hero-cta\" >< a class = \"button button-shadow\" href = \"#\" > Learn more </ a >< a id = 'checkout-button' class = \"button button-primary button-shadow\" href = \"#\" > Buy Now </ a ></ div > </ div > Directly below the </div> line, add: < script src = \"https://js.stripe.com/v3/\" ></ script > < script > const checkout_pk = '{{checkout_pk}}' ; const checkout_id = '{{checkout_id}}' ; var stripe = Stripe ( checkout_pk ) const button = document . querySelector ( '#checkout-button' ) button . addEventListener ( 'click' , event =>{ stripe . redirectToCheckout ({ sessionId : checkout_id }). then ( function ( result ){ }); }) </ script > This code adds a JavaScript event which will trigger when the customer clicks the \"Buy Now\" button, and will redirect them to the Stripe Checkout page. The Stripe Checkout page changes according to the information stored in checkout_id . Also, take a look at the Jinja code in these lines: const checkout_pk = '{{checkout_pk}}' ; const checkout_id = '{{checkout_id}}' ; When the index.html template is rendered before being served to the user, Flask will substitute in the current values of the Python variables that we passed to render_template() . While checkout_pk will remain the same throughout, checkout_id will be unique for each purchase. The \"Buy Now\" button is good to go \u2013 run app.py again. Try making a payment using the test credit card number 4242 4242 4242 4242 with any name, expiration date, and security code. No charges will be incurred. Hosting the Application on Code Capsules Now that we've added all the functionality, we need to create some files that Code Capsules will use when hosting our application. We'll also take a look at a security problem in our current application, and how to fix it before we go live. Creating the \"requirements.txt\" file and procfile To host this application on Code Capsules, we need to create a requirements.txt file and a Procfile . In the project directory, ensure the virtual environment is activated and then enter pip3 freeze > requirements.txt . Create another file named Procfile , containg the line web: gunicorn app:app . With the requirements.txt file, Code Capsules will now know what libraries to install to run the application. The Procfile tells Code Capsules to use the gunicorn WSGI server to serve HTML rendered by Flask to end-users. Now we can fix that security problem mentioned before, and host the application. Removing secret keys We need to send our application to GitHub so Code Capsules can host it. But currently this project's code contains all of our API keys. It is considered very poor practice to send personal API keys to GitHub, especially public repositories. Anyone could find them and incur charges on your debit card. Luckily, there is a workaround. By working with environment variables , we can use our API keys on Code Capsules without exposing them on GitHub. We will alter our application to retrieve our API keys from environment variables, which we will set on Code Capsules. To do this, change the code at the top of app.py as follows: from flask import Flask , render_template , request import requests , stripe , os app = Flask ( __name__ ) app . config [ 'STRIPE_PK' ] = os . getenv ( \"STRIPE_PK\" ) app . config [ 'STRIPE_SK' ] = os . getenv ( \"STRIPE_SK\" ) stripe . api_key = app . config [ 'STRIPE_SK' ] Notice that we've imported a new Python module, os , which allows us to retrieve with environment variables using the os.getenv() method. We've now done this with our Stripe publishable and secret API keys and our Mailgun secret key. On Code Capsules, we'll set environment variables named 'STRIPE_PK' , 'STRIPE_SK' , and 'MAILGUN_SK' . This way, our API keys do not have to be stored on GitHub and will remain secret. Notice, we aren't adding environment variables for the Stripe product API key. This doesn't contain any sensitive information. It just displays a product's price. Your final app.py code should look like this: from flask import Flask , render_template , request import requests , stripe , os app = Flask ( __name__ ) app . config [ 'STRIPE_PK' ] = os . getenv ( \"STRIPE_PK\" ) app . config [ 'STRIPE_SK' ] = os . getenv ( \"STRIPE_SK\" ) stripe . api_key = app . config [ 'STRIPE_SK' ] def subscribe ( user_email , email_list , api_key ): return requests . post ( \"https://api.mailgun.net/v3/lists/\" + email_list + \"/members\" , auth = ( 'api' , api_key ), data = { 'subscribed' : True , 'address' : user_email ,}) @app . route ( \"/\" , methods = [ \"GET\" , \"POST\" ]) def index (): session = stripe . checkout . Session . create ( payment_method_types = [ 'card' ], mode = 'payment' , success_url = 'https://example.com/success' , cancel_url = 'https://example.com/cancel' , line_items = [{ 'price' : 'YOUR-PRICE-API-KEY' , 'quantity' : 1 , }] ) if request . method == \"POST\" : user_email = request . form . get ( 'email' ) response = subscribe ( user_email , 'MAILGUN_ALIAS' , os . getenv ( \"MAILGUN_SK\" )) return render_template ( \"index.html\" , checkout_id = session [ 'id' ], checkout_pk = app . config [ 'STRIPE_PK' ], ) if __name__ == '__main__' : app . run ( debug = True ) We can now safely host our application. Pushing to GitHub and hosting the application on Code Capsules Before we create the Capsule that will host our code, take the following steps: Create a GitHub repository for the application. Send all code within the project directory to the repository on GitHub. Log in to Code Capsules . Grant Code Capsules access to the repository. Create a Team and Space as necessary. Now let's create the Capsule: Click \"Create A New Capsule\". Select your repository. Choose the Backend Capsule type. Create the Capsule. All that's left is to set the environment variables. Navigate to the Capsule and click on the \"Config\" tab. Use the image below as a guide to properly add your environment variables. Replace each value with the appropriate API key. After entering the API keys, make sure to click \"Update\" . All done \u2013 now anyone can view the web application and interact with the \"Buy Now\" and \"Subscribe\" buttons.

When render_template(\"index.html\") runs, Flask will look in the templates directory for a file named index.html and render it by executing its Jinja template code and serving the resulting HTML. To see this, run app.py with flask run in your terminal.

When you send an email to your alias address, Mailgun sends a copy of the email to everyone who is subscribed to your mailing list. Jot down your alias address, we'll use it soon. Next, you'll need to retrieve the API key for your Mailgun account. We'll use this API key in our web application to validate your Mailgun account when people subscribe to your mailing list.

When the user clicks on the button, an HTTP request will be sent from their browser to our Flask backend, containing the email address. As per the method attribute of the form tag, this will be a [POST request. Recall that the Python code we entered in the last section provided for both GET and POST HTTP requests. As submitting this form will also send a request to \"/\", we can differentiate between a user browsing to our website ( GET ) and subscribing to our mailing list ( POST ) by looking at the HTTP method.

Here we'll see two API keys \u2013 a publishable API key, and a secret API key. You can think of these as a username and password. Stripe uses the publishable API key to identify your account, and the secret API key to ensure it's really you using it. Open the app.py file.

We also return two new variables \u2013 checkout_id and checkout_pk . checkout_id , which we get from Stripe, stores information about the potential purchase (price, payment type, etc). checkout_pk stores our private API key, which we added to the Flask app's configuration settings above.

But currently this project's code contains all of our API keys. It is considered very poor practice to send personal API keys to GitHub, especially public repositories. Anyone could find them and incur charges on your debit card. Luckily, there is a workaround. By working with environment variables , we can use our API keys on Code Capsules without exposing them on GitHub. We will alter our application to retrieve our API keys from environment variables, which we will set on Code Capsules. To do this, change the code at the top of app.py as follows: from flask import Flask , render_template , request import requests , stripe , os app = Flask ( __name__ ) app . config [ 'STRIPE_PK' ] = os . getenv ( \"STRIPE_PK\" ) app . config [ 'STRIPE_SK' ] = os . getenv ( \"STRIPE_SK\" ) stripe . api_key = app . config [ 'STRIPE_SK' ] Notice that we've imported a new Python module, os , which allows us to retrieve with environment variables using the os.getenv() method. We've now done this with our Stripe publishable and secret API keys and our Mailgun secret key. On Code Capsules, we'll set environment variables named 'STRIPE_PK' , 'STRIPE_SK' , and 'MAILGUN_SK' . This way, our API keys do not have to be stored on GitHub and will remain secret. Notice, we aren't adding environment variables for the Stripe product API key. This doesn't contain any sensitive information. It just displays a product's price.
