We could choose to use any of these three types of services to build our application, but each one has different pros and cons. The chosen service will determine both the skills we'll need, and the limitations we'll need to work with.</p> <p>Roughly speaking, we will need greater depth and breadth of technical expertise as you move up the ladder from SaaS to IaaS, but we'll also have more flexibility. Below, we'll go through each one and discuss how we might use it to build our budgeting application.</p>","title":"SaaS vs PaaS vs IaaS"},{"location":"comparisons/saas-paas-iaas/#software-as-a-service-saas","text":"Pros Cons     Quick to get started with. Limited flexibility.   Requires little or no programming knowledge. Significant vendor lock-in.     Likely to be inefficient and costly at scale.    <p>Just about any application that runs in your browser can be considered Software as a Service (SaaS). SaaS examples include Google Drive and its associated office suite \u2013 Google Docs, Google Sheets, and others \u2013 as well as other file management services like Dropbox, communication platforms like Slack, and knowledge management solutions like Notion and Confluence.</p> <p>If we were to build a budgeting application using SaaS, we could do it without writing a large amount of code. We could start with a simple Google Sheet, attached to a Google Form, where the user would manually enter each transaction they make during the month. The user would specify the amount, whether it's an income, expense or investment, and add a comment about what it was for: e.g. \"Monthly salary\" or \"Groceries\". We could then use macros to calculate the user's total income and expenditure for each month.</p> <p>We could make this more complex by using multiple forms and spreadsheets to do things like allowing the user to set up a budget at the beginning of each month. We could also integrate investments into our spreadsheets, using the GOOGLEFINANCE macro to fetch stock prices in real time.</p> <p>We could then expand out of spreadsheets and forms by using another SaaS platform like IFTTT or Zapier to send a monthly digest email to the user's G-mail address, or warning emails if they start coming close to their allotted budget for a particular kind of expense. And if the user is more active on Slack than on email, we could also set up Slack alerts.</p> <p>If we want something more than email and Slack alterts, we could use a SaaS platform such as Glide to build a custom application using our original spreadsheets as a data backend. With a bit of tweaking, we could make it possible for others to use it, too.</p> <p>Our full application architecture would now look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>In this way, we can get a fully functional budgetting application with multiple integrations working by using different SaaS solutions together, and without writing any code. However, if we're interested in building a business out of this application, we may soon run into problems like expensive per-user fees and a lack of flexibility and control. Glide's visual editor may not allow us to design our application in the exact way we want to, or we may run up against the limitations of what sorts of data analysis can reasonably be done using spreadsheets.</p> <p>SaaS platforms also have the strongest vendor lock-in of the three types of services discussed in this article. If the SaaS we're using closes down or radically changes its software, we may be unable to extract all of your data. And even if we are able to extract our data, it's unlikely that we'll be able to import it directly into a different SaaS and keep going.</p> <p>For example, if our budget application uses a lot of functionality specific to Google Sheets, such as the GOOGLEFINANCE macro, and Google decides to shut down Sheets, we should be able to download our sheets as XLSX files and move them to a competing platform, such as Microsoft Office 365. But we'll then have to do a lot of manual tinkering to get everything to work again on this new service. In some cases, we may even have to remove functionality that's not supported by the new service.</p> <p>And seeing as we're using multiple SaaS platforms together, as in the above architecture, we're dependent on them continuing to support each other. For example, if Slack changes its API in a way that breaks Zapier's integration with it, our budgeting application's Slack integration will be broken until Zapier updates their software. Worse still, if Slack chooses to stop supporting the kinds of integrations we want, we will have to scramble to find an alternative solution to notify users about their budgets.</p> <p>SaaS solutions provide a great way to quickly prototype ideas, but may prove unreliable and limiting if you need them to work over a long timescale or for a large number of users. Using Google Sheets and some integrations to build a budgeting app for yourself is not a bad idea, and you could even develop it to the point of accepting other users, but if you want to build a sustainable business with your application, you may be better off looking into a PaaS or IaaS solution instead.</p>","title":"Software as a Service (SaaS)"},{"location":"comparisons/saas-paas-iaas/#platform-as-a-service-paas","text":"Pros Cons     Requires no infrastructure set-up. May be inefficient or costly at scale.   The vendor is responsible for system maintenance and security patches. Less vendor lock-in than SaaS, more than IaaS.    <p>Unlike most SaaS solutions, Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions are specifically intended for use by developers. You can think of a PaaS as anywhere you can upload code and have it automatically deployed and run. PaaS solutions include Code Capsules, Heroku, Netlify, Google App Engine and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.</p> <p>If you've deployed a Capsule before, you'll be familiar with the process of working with a PaaS. If you haven't, it generally goes like this:</p> <ol> <li>Write application code in a language and framework of your choice.</li> <li>Push code to a source code repository on a code hosting platform such as GitHub.</li> <li>Link your GitHub profile to the PaaS of your choice, locate the repository you want to deploy, and click \"Deploy\".</li> <li>Your application will be live on a URL that looks like myapp.paas.com.</li> </ol> <p>Depending on the PaaS and the type of application being deployed, the developer may need to include deployment configuration instructions with their application code. For example, in many of our tutorials, it is necessary to create files named <code>Procfile</code> and <code>requirements.txt</code> prior to deployment.</p> <p>Users of a PaaS will need to write a lot of code. In return, they get flexibility and a reduced level of vendor lock-in compared to building on SaaS solutions. Writing your own custom code gives you far more customisation options and areas where you can make specific optimisations. Users of PaaS solutions do not require system administration knowledge, as the PaaS will be responsible for configuring their code to run correctly.</p> <p>Different PaaS solutions target different parts of the standard three-layer application stack made up of frontend (HTML and JavaScript that runs in users' browsers), backend (code that runs on servers) and data persistence (databases and datastores that record information such as user login details).</p> <p>Some PaaS solutions are highly focused on a single part of the stack, while others offer solutions for multiple areas of the stack. The table below gives some examples of each.</p>    Areas of the stack PaaS solution examples     Frontend Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3, GitHub Pages, Code Capsules (Frontend capsules)   Backend Heroku, OpenShift, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, Code Capsules (Backend capsules)   Data persistence MongoDB Atlas, AWS RDS, Azure SQL Database    <p>Frontend code can be included with backend code, and some PaaS solutions offer data persistence solutions, so you may be able to deploy a complete application as a single project on a single PaaS, but you can also use multiple PaaS solutions for different stack components.</p> <p>If we were to build our budgeting application on PaaS solutions, we would start by writing the application code. We might do this in Python with a framework like Flask, in Node.js with a framework like Express, in Ruby with a framework like Sinatra, or any number of other languages, depending on PaaS support. We may also use a frontend framework such as Vue or React. We would also need to choose a data store: either a relational database like PostgreSQL or a NoSQL document store like MongoDB. Then we would need to choose one or more PaaS solutions which supports our chosen technologies.</p> <p>Let's say we developed our budgeting application using Code Capsules to host our back- and frontend code and MongoDB Atlas to store our data. We could combine the backend and frontend code into a single backend capsule. Alternatively, we could create a frontend capsule with our application frontend and have it interact with an API created in a backend capsule \u2013 we might do this if we wanted to reuse our backend for a mobile application.</p> <p>Our budgeting app would be a web application with user login. Custom functionality would need to be developed for entering transactions, setting budgets and viewing spending reports, but we would have total flexibility in how all of this worked, without being constrained by the interfaces of Google Sheets or Google Forms. For example, we could create specialised forms for common transactions with user-friendly features like autocomplete based on existing data.</p> <p>If we're feeling really ambitious, we could integrate open banking into our application and have transactions fetched automatically rather than having to enter them manually.</p> <p>Using a single backend capsule, our application architecture would look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Using a backend and frontend capsule, our application architecture would look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>In the above architecture, we could replace the frontend module with a Netlify site, and the backend module with a collection of AWS Lambda functions, or just about any other PaaS solution that provides the appropriate area of the stack.</p> <p>Using PaaS solutions is the middleground between using SaaS and IaaS solutions in terms of ease of setup versus flexibility and control. Using a PaaS will lead to some level of vendor lock-in, especially if you use something like AWS Lambda. However, in most cases, we will be able to move our code to a different PaaS if the one we're using shuts down or stops supporting something we rely on. We may have to do some reconfiguration, but this is likely to be less onerous than moving between SaaS solutions.</p> <p>As we are not doing our own system administration when we use a PaaS solution, we won't be able to optimise our infrastructure for the needs of our application. If we're not careful about how we design our application, it may end up being much more expensive to run than it would be on an IaaS solution.</p>","title":"Platform as a Service (PaaS)"},{"location":"comparisons/saas-paas-iaas/#infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas","text":"Pros Cons     Highly flexible. Requires programming and system administration knowledge.   Can be configured more precisely and efficiently than SaaS and PaaS solutions. Requires regular maintenance.   Very little vendor lock-in ...    <p>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solutions are the most technically demanding of their users. Rather than providing end-user software or deployment for user-developed code, most IaaS solutions merely provide you with virtual machines (VMs), commonly called a \"compute instance\". These are fully capable computers that you have full control over and responsibility for. Examples of IaaS services include AWS Elastic Computing (EC) 2, Google Cloud Platform's Compute Engine, and Digital Ocean's Droplets.</p> <p>To deploy an app using an IaaS solution, we follow these general steps:</p> <ol> <li>Create a virtual machine, specifying how much CPU power, RAM and hard drive storage space you want, as well as its operating system.</li> <li>Specify firewall rules for this virtual machine \u2013 for most simple web applications, you'll need to specify that TCP ports 80 and 443 should be open, as well as port 22, for your remote access.</li> <li>Access your virtual machine over a secure shell (SSH), generally using an SSH key like you would with GitHub.</li> <li>Install a web server, database management system, and all the other requirements for your application.</li> <li>Upload your application's code to your server.</li> <li>Ensure that all of your supporting software is configured correctly and your application's code files can be located and read by your webserver, and then start your application.</li> <li>Buy a domain name and configure it to point to the IP address of your virtual server.</li> </ol> <p>This is quite a lot more effort than using a PaaS, and it requires some specialised knowledge in addition to programming.</p> <p>In our budgeting app example, we would be able to take the same code you might deploy to a PaaS and use that on an IaaS: for example, we could take code we've uploaded to Code Capsules and upload it to an AWS EC2 instance instead. We would just need to install and set up your own webserver (usually Apache or nginx), and our own database (either a traditional relational database like PostgreSQL or a NoSQL document store like MongoDB).</p> <p>We could also put the database on a second EC2 instance, and configure your networking rules to allow both instances to speak to each other over the relevant port. Our application architecture would look now look like the diagram below. Note that we would retain our open banking integration, as that is defined in code.</p> <p></p> <p>The benefit this gives you is total control over your infrastructure, which can have efficiency and cost savings over working with a PaaS. How much will depend on your level of expertise and the amount of time you can allocate to optimising and managing your infrastructure. Depending on our application's architecture, we might create more than one VM for serving the application and managing the database, using load balancers and data replication. Alternatively, we may just dynamically increase the CPU speed, RAM and disk space of one or two VMs.</p> <p>The other major benefit to using IaaS over SaaS or PaaS is that it has essentially no vendor lock-in. Just about everything you do on an AWS EC2 instance will work just as well on a virtual machine provided by Google Compute Engine or Digital Ocean, or even a physical server in a pre-cloud datacentre.</p> <p>But with great power comes great responsibility. Anything we build on an IaaS solution will require regular maintenance \u2013 we will be responsible for keeping our virtual machines' software up-to-date.

We'll first add an HTML upload form to the <code>index.hbs</code> file in the <code>views</code> folder. Add this code under the <code>&lt;h1&gt;{{title}}&lt;/h1&gt;</code> line: </p> <p><pre><code>&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;h2&gt;Upload a file&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;form ref='uploadForm' \n      id='uploadForm' \n      action='/' \n      method='post' \n      encType=\"multipart/form-data\"&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"file\" name=\"newFile\" /&gt;\n        &lt;input type='submit' value='Upload' /&gt;\n    &lt;/form&gt; \n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre> This code adds in a new HTML form, which makes a <code>POST</code> request to the root <code>/</code> (our index page) on submit. We've given the form 2 inputs: a file upload field specified by the <code>type=\"file\"</code> attribute, and the submit button. Note the <code>name</code> given to the file input - we'll need to remember this when processing the upload on the server side. </p> <p>Now that we have a way for the user to select a file to upload and send to the server, we need to create a route to process the submitted file. In the <code>index.js</code> file in the  <code>routes</code> folder, we'll add a new HTTP route. This one will be a POST route, as we are using it to upload a new file (or resource) onto the server. Add this stub for the route in the <code>index.js</code> file: </p> <p><pre><code>router.post('/', function(req, res){\n\n}); \n</code></pre> To handle file uploads with Express, we'll use a package that takes care of all the encoding and streaming concerns of file uploads. Open up the terminal and install the <code>express-fileupload</code> package using npm: </p> <p><pre><code>npm install express-fileupload\n</code></pre> To use this package, we need to add it into the middleware of our Express server. Open up the <code>app.js</code> file in the root folder of the project, and import the package by adding the following <code>require</code> statement at the top of the file:</p> <pre><code>const fileUpload = require('express-fileupload');\n</code></pre> <p>Now insert the package into the Express middleware pipeline by adding the following line just under the <code>var app = express();</code> statement:</p> <pre><code>app.use(fileUpload());\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>express-fileupload</code> module adds a <code>files</code> attribute to our <code>req</code> object. Through the <code>files</code> attribute we can access any uploads as their own objects, which are named the same as the HTML form <code>inputs</code>. </p> <p>Now we can expand on the route stub. In the <code>index.js</code> file, complete the <code>POST</code> route as follows:</p> <p><pre><code>router.post('/', function(req, res){\n\n    if (!req.files || Object.keys(req.files).length === 0) {\n      return res.status(400).send('No files were uploaded.');\n    }\n\n    const newFile = req.files.newFile;\n    const uploadPath = process.env.PERSISTENT_STORAGE_DIR + '/' + newFile.name;\n\n    newFile.mv(uploadPath, function(err) {\n      if (err) return res.status(500).send(err);\n      return res.redirect('/');\n    });\n\n});\n</code></pre> First, we check whether the <code>files</code> object exists on the route, and if it does exist, we check whether it has sub-objects on the list (no sub-objects means no form <code>input</code> fields were populated). If no <code>files</code> objects or sub-objects exist on the route, there is no file for the code to process, so we return early with an HTTP status <code>400</code> code and a message to the user. Status code <code>400</code> means there is an input error from the user side. </p> <p>Otherwise, having established that a file has been uploaded, we get the file object by referencing the same name we gave to our HTML input field (<code>newFile</code>) on the <code>files</code> object that the <code>express-fileupload</code> package added to the <code>req</code> object. Now that we have the file object, we can construct a path to the data capsule's location to save the file. We use the environment variable for the data capsule mount point (located in the Backend Capsule's \"Capsule Parameters\"), along with the path separator <code>/</code> and the name of the uploaded file. You can see all the properties available on the file object at the <code>express-fileupload</code> npm page. </p> <p>All we need to do now is to save the file to the upload path. The <code>express-fileupload</code> package provides the method <code>mv</code> on the file object to save the file to a disk location. It then calls a provided callback function when done, or if an error occurs. If we get a error back, we send an HTTP code <code>500</code> back to the client, which means that there was an error on the server side. Otherwise, if all goes well, we redirect the client to the index <code>/</code> page, which will call the <code>GET</code> route added earlier to refresh the file list on the client side.</p> <p>This is a good point to commit the code to Git, and test the new deployment on Code Capsules. After the capsule finishes rebuilding, navigate to the site. It should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>The upload control may look slightly different depending on the web browser and operating system you use.

Then the function constructs a path to the file, using the environment variable for the data capsule mount point, along with the path separator <code>/</code> and the name of the requested file.</p> <p>Then we call the <code>download</code> method on the <code>res</code> (result) object with the constructed path. This sends the file to the browser. </p> <p>Now we need a way to call this route from the front end.

We can use the HTTP <code>DELETE</code> verb on a route for this. </p> <p>Since the data capsule appears just like a regular file system to our code, we can use the built-in Node.js <code>fs</code> module here again. It has a method called <code>unlink</code> which deletes a file from a file system. We supply it with a path to the file, and a callback function to let us know the result of the delete file request. If we get an error, we'll send an HTTP code <code>500</code> status back to the browser, to let the browser know that an error occurred. If the delete action is successful, we'll send a status code <code>200</code>, which lets the browser know that the operation was a success. Add this code to the <code>index.js</code> file to implement the <code>DELETE</code> route: </p> <pre><code>router.delete('/:filename', function(req, res){\n  const filepath = process.env.PERSISTENT_STORAGE_DIR + '/' + req.params.filename; \n\n  fs.unlink(filepath, function (err) {\n    if (err) return res.sendStatus(500); \n    else return res.sendStatus(200); \n  }); \n\n}); \n</code></pre> <p>Now let's update the front end to be able to call this route. Open the <code>index.hbs</code> file, and add a new header column to the file table, along with a button for each file in the new column to delete it:</p> <pre><code>&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;h2&gt;File list&lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;table&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;File Name&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n      {{#each files}}\n      &lt;tr&gt;\n        &lt;td&gt; \n            &lt;a href='/{{this}}' target=\"_blank\"&gt;{{this}}&lt;/a&gt; \n        &lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;td&gt;\n          &lt;button&gt;Delete&lt;/button&gt;\n        &lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;/tr&gt;\n      {{/each}}\n  &lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Next we'll create some front-end JavaScript code for the button to call when clicked. We'll use the browser-side <code>fetch</code> function to call the <code>DELETE</code> file route. Add this script block at the bottom of the <code>index.hbs</code> file: </p> <pre><code>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n  function deleteFile(filename){\n\n    var confirmation = confirm('Do you really want to delete the file ' + filename + '?'); \n    if (confirmation === true){\n      fetch('/' + filename, { method: 'DELETE' })\n      .then(response =&gt; location.reload())\n      .catch(error =&gt; alert('Error deleting the file! ' + error)); \n    }\n  }\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>This adds a new function <code>deleteFile</code> to the front-end index page. It has one argument: the name of the file to delete. First, we make use of the built-in <code>confirm</code> function which exists in all browsers. This brings up a dialog box with the message Do you really want to delete the file?, just to make sure the user didn't click the delete button accidentally. If the user clicks \"Yes\", the dialog box returns a <code>true</code> value. Then we call our <code>DELETE</code> route using <code>fetch</code>. We need to pass in the route to call, and we also send an init object which specifies that the <code>DELETE</code> HTTP verb must be used to call this route.</p> <p>The <code>fetch</code> function returns a <code>promise</code>. This is an alternative to callbacks. If the call was successful, the code in the <code>.then()</code> handler is called. This reloads the page, so that the file listing is updated to show that the file is now deleted. If the call fails, the code in the <code>catch</code> handler is called. This uses another standard browser dialog, an <code>alert</code>, to let the user know that something went wrong. </p> <p>Now let's hook this function up to the button we added for each file. We'll use the <code>onclick</code> event on the buttons to call the function, along with the filename to be deleted. Update the button code like this: </p> <pre><code>&lt;button onclick=\"deleteFile('{{this}}')\"&gt;Delete&lt;/button&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Commit these changes, and wait for Code Capsules to redeploy the site.

We need a way to control access. For this tutorial, we'll implement a very simple access control system that only allows access to one pre-defined user.</p> <p>We're going to use Passport to handle our access control. Passport is a modular package that allows for very simple authentication schemes to very elaborate ones, so you can upgrade the security of this app as you need.</p> <p>Our basic access control scheme is a username and password combination, entered on an HTML form that is posted to a <code>login</code> route. A session cookie will remember the logged-in user while they use the site, and we'll use the package <code>express-session</code> to manage the session. </p> <p>Passport's local strategy plugin will enable our username and password scheme.  </p> <p>Let's start by installing all these packages and plugins. Type the following in the terminal:</p> <pre><code>npm install passport passport-local express-session\n</code></pre> <p>Now add references to these packages to the top section of the <code>app.js</code> file. A good place to add them is after the <code>var logger = require('morgan');</code> line. Here's the code you'll need:</p> <pre><code>var passport = require('passport'); \nvar LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy;\nvar session = require(\"express-session\");\n</code></pre> <p>The first thing to add to the app is the session middleware, then the Passport authentication middleware. Add the following after the <code>app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));</code> line: </p> <p><pre><code>app.use(session({secret : \"&lt;YOUR_SECRET&gt;\"})); \napp.use(passport.initialize());\napp.use(passport.session());\n</code></pre> This inserts the <code>session</code> middleware into the app pipeline, to read and write persistent sessions to the app cookie. Replace the <code>&lt;YOUR_SECRET&gt;</code> parameter with a string of your choosing. This secret is used to sign the session information in the cookie. Normally, this is kept very secret, as anyone who has access to the secret could construct a session cookie that looks legitimate to the server and give them access to any account on the server. You can also add an environment variable to store this secret, rather than store it in the code repo. </p> <p>Next, we initialize Passport into the middleware pipeline, and add in the code for Passport to use sessions to check and record authentication. </p> <p>When using sessions with Passport, we need to implement serialisation and deserialisation of user objects from session information, so that Passport can add the user object to the <code>req</code> object in the app pipeline. Add these functions to the bottom of the <code>app.js</code> file: </p> <p><pre><code>passport.serializeUser(function(user, done) {\n  process.nextTick(function(){\n    done(null, user);\n  }); \n});\n\npassport.deserializeUser(function(user, done) { \n  process.nextTick(function(){\n    done(null, user);\n  }); \n});\n</code></pre> In our case, since we are implementing a super-simple authentication scheme with just one user, we don't need to call out to a database or other store to get user information. In fact, since there is no real user information that is of use to our app at the moment, we just return the <code>user</code> object that Passport sends to us straight back, as we don't really have a use for it. Even though we are doing nothing with the information, we need to register these functions with Passport, as it calls them regardless. </p> <p>Now we can set up the rest of the logic for Passport. Add this code just above the serialisation code: </p> <pre><code>passport.use(new LocalStrategy(\n  function(username, password, done) {\n    if (username === process.env.USERNAME &amp;&amp; password === process.env.PASSWORD){\n      return done(null, {username: process.env.USERNAME }); \n    }\n    else {\n      return done(null, false, {message: \"Incorrect username or password\"}); \n    }\n  })\n);\n</code></pre> <p>This plugs in and registers the local authentication strategy module into Passport.</p> <p>Passport's local strategy uses a simple username and password, checked on the local server, so we'll need a function to accept a username and password for validation. The function checks if entered credentials are valid, and sends back a user object if they are, using the <code>done</code> callback. If the credentials don't checkout, the user gets an error message.</p> <p>Our function checks the username and password against what is stored in our environment variables. If the credentials to be checked match the credentials in our environment variables, we authenticate the user. </p> <p>Head over to the \"Configure\" tab on your backend Code Capsule, and add 2 new environment variables : <code>USERNAME</code> and <code>PASSWORD</code>. Supply values of your own to set your username and password, then click the \"Update Capsule\" button to save the changes.</p> <p></p> <p>Note: While this method of storing user credentials is appropriate for a small, single-user hobby project, it is not sufficient for production with customer credentials. Look to implementing a more robust user store, with password hashing and salting, or using a third-party authentication service such as a social network or an OAuth provider</p> <p>Passport offers many other authentication strategies, from OAuth 2.0 strategies allowing authentication through Facebook, Google, Twitter and other OAuth 2.0 providers, to API authentication strategies such as Bearer Tokens.</p> <p>Now that we have set the username and password for our app, we can add the login page routes to render the login page and send the form <code>POST</code> with user credentials to Passport. </p> <p>Add these 2 routes just above the index routes (<code>app.use('/', indexRouter);</code>) in <code>app.js</code>: </p> <pre><code>app.get('/login', function(req,res){\n    return res.render('login')\n}); \napp.post('/login',\n  passport.authenticate('local', { successRedirect: '/', failureRedirect: '/login' }));\n</code></pre> <p>The first <code>GET</code> route adds a <code>/login</code> url to our app. The route handler function calls the <code>res.render</code> Express method to serve up the login template, which we'll add shortly. The second <code>POST</code> route handles a form submission from the <code>/login</code> route, and passes it through to Passport. We supply a parameter to tell Passport to use our <code>local</code> strategy to process this authentication request. We also supply the redirects: to the main file list if authentication is successful, or back to the login page if not.</p> <p>There's one more bit of code to include before we add the front-end login form. We need to check if a user is successfully authenticated before they can access the file list and other functionality. To do this, we'll insert a call to an authentication check function in our app middleware. Add this code just above the <code>app.use('/', indexRouter);</code> line, so it's called before the routes above are served: </p> <pre><code>app.use(isAuthenticated); \n</code></pre> <p>Now, let's implement the reference <code>isAuthenticated</code> middleware. Add this function to the bottom of the <code>app.js</code> file: </p> <pre><code>function isAuthenticated(req, res, next) {\n  if (req.isAuthenticated())\n    return next();\n  else \n    return res.redirect('/login');\n}\n</code></pre> <p>If a user is successfully authenticated, the <code>isAuthenticated()</code> method, which is added by Passport to the <code>req</code> object, will return <code>true</code>. In that case, we can safely let the pipeline proceed to the next middleware function (in this case, one of the protected routes). If the authentication check comes back <code>false</code>, we redirect back to the login page, away from our protected pages. </p> <p>Now we have all the back-end pieces for authentication in place, let's add the login page and form. Add a new file called <code>login.hbs</code> in the <code>views</code> folder. Place this code into the new file: </p> <p><pre><code>&lt;form action=\"/login\" method=\"post\"&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;label&gt;Username:&lt;/label&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"username\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;label&gt;Password:&lt;/label&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"password\" name=\"password\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Log In\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n</code></pre> Here we're adding a very simple form to make a <code>POST</code> request back to our <code>/login</code> route, with inputs for a username and password. </p> <p>We're done with authentication. Commit these changes, and wait for Code Capsules to redeploy the site, then navigate over and test it out. This time, the site should prompt for your username and password (which you added to the environment variables) before letting you through to the files page.</p> <p></p> <p>Congratulations, you have completed building a personal web drive using Code Capsules and Node.js!</p>","title":"Adding Authentication"},{"location":"tutorials/build-a-web-file-store/#next-steps","text":"<p>This project has some decent basic functionality, but there are many things you could add to upgrade it, such as: </p> <ul> <li>Add styling to make it look better</li> <li>Add support for sub-folders</li> <li>Add support for multi-file upload</li> <li>Add logout functionality, using the Passport logout function</li> <li>Add better authentication, and perhaps separate user accounts for a multi-user drive</li> </ul>","title":"Next Steps"},{"location":"tutorials/build-flask-htmx-app/","text":"<p></p> <p>[This tutorial explains how to build an application with Flask and HTMx.

This is the HTMx way of denoting what type of request should be sent on form submission or when a request firing event is triggered. These attributes accept the request route as an argument. In the case of our form, we use the <code>/submit</code> route, while the table buttons send requests to the <code>/delete</code> and <code>/get-edit-form</code> routes.</p> </li> <li> <p>hx-target \u2013 This attribute accepts the <code>id</code> of the element you want to update after a successful request or when an event is triggered. Take note of the preceding <code>#</code> that\u2019s written before the <code>id</code> value. </p> <ul> <li>You might have noticed that we didn\u2019t use an <code>id</code> value in the table, but used a value of <code>closest tr</code> instead. This swaps the closest table row with the HTML that will be returned by the request when an action is triggered. The closest row will always be the same row in which an event or request was triggered, either by the \u201cEdit Title\u201d button or the \u201cDelete\u201d button. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>hx-swap \u2013 The hx-swap attribute allows you to specify how you want to partially reload the page or swap elements with new ones. It updates the UI in the section specified in the <code>hx-target</code> attribute.</p> <ul> <li>In our form, we used the <code>beforeend</code> value to tell HTMx that we want to append the result of the request after the last child in the target element, which is the table with <code>id=new-book</code>. </li> <li>In the table however, we used the <code>outerHTML</code> value to denote that we want to swap the entire <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> element with the returned content.</li> <li>A full list of acceptable <code>hx-swap</code> values can be viewed here.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>","title":"Building the HTMx Frontend"},{"location":"tutorials/build-flask-htmx-app/#building-the-flask-backend","text":"<p>We can now dive into building the backend of our app. Start by creating a <code>run.py</code> file in the project\u2019s root folder and populate it with the code below:</p> <pre><code>from app import app\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run()\n</code></pre> <p>This is the point of entry for any server wishing to run our app.</p>","title":"Building the Flask Backend"},{"location":"tutorials/build-flask-htmx-app/#declare-and-initialize-app-module","text":"<p>Create an <code>__init__.py</code> file in the <code>app</code> folder and populate it with the code below:</p> <pre><code>from flask import Flask\nfrom flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\napp.config[\"SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI\"] = 'sqlite:///sqlite.db'\napp.config[\"SQLALCHEMY_ECHO\"] = False\napp.config[\"SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS\"] = False\n\ndb = SQLAlchemy(app)\n\nfrom app import views\nfrom app import models\n\ndb.init_app(app)\ndb.create_all() \n</code></pre> <p>Here we declare our app object using the Flask package we installed earlier.

The logic first checks if the author already exists in the database and if so, saves the book with the author\u2019s <code>author_id</code>. Otherwise, it creates a new author and then saves the book. As HTMx expects an HTML response, the <code>submit</code> method responds with an HTML table row that updates the list of books on the frontend. The new entry will be for the recently added book. </p> <p>Next, let\u2019s add the code for the <code>/delete</code> route. Copy and paste the code below:</p> <pre><code>@app.route(\"/delete/&lt;int:id&gt;\", methods=[\"DELETE\"])\ndef delete_book(id):\n    book = Book.query.get(id)\n    db.session.delete(book)\n    db.session.commit()\n\n    return \"\"\n</code></pre> <p>The first thing you may have noticed about this route is the <code>id</code> query parameter it accepts. This allows us to know which object to delete. After deleting the book, we return an empty string, which causes the row we deleted in the frontend to disappear, as it is swapped for \u201cnothing\u201d. </p> <p>We now have routes for creating, reading, and deleting books.

The <code>update_book</code> function that\u2019s bound to the <code>/update</code> route will update the book title based on the <code>id</code> supplied to it as a query parameter.

Let's implement the slash command, which will allow us to ask our app for some of its important stats and info. This time, Slack will send an HTTP POST to our app. If we take a look at the Slack docs again, we notice that Slack will send the slash command instruction to the URL we specified in the command set up earlier. We can also see that the POST payload is in the format <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. We can set up a <code>body-parser</code> to interpret this data.</p> <p>Let's extend our code with the snippet below to implement the slash command receiver as specified in the Slack docs. First add a require statement for <code>body-parser</code> at the top.</p> <pre><code>const bodyParser = require(\"body-parser\");\n</code></pre> <p>Then add the code below: </p> <p><pre><code>app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded());\n\napp.post('/slack/command/stats', [function(req,res){\n  const slackReqObj = req.body;\n  const packageJson = require('./package.json');\n\n  const current_time = new Date(); \n  const stats = {\n    name: packageJson.name,\n    version: packageJson.version,\n    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,\n    platform: process.platform,\n    architecture: process.arch,\n    node_version: process.version,\n    pid: process.pid,\n    current_server_time: current_time.toString(),\n    uptime: process.uptime(),\n    memory_usage: process.memoryUsage()\n  };\n\n  const response = {\n    response_type: 'in_channel',\n    channel: slackReqObj.channel_id,\n    text: JSON.stringify(stats, null, '\\t')\n  };\n\n  return res.json(response); \n}]);\n</code></pre> This code listens for incoming POST calls on the line <code>app.post('/slack/command/stats', [function(req,res){</code>. If we receive one, we build up a return object, consisting of various interesting stats and info. This includes the current time on the server (in case it is in a different time zone to us), the name and version of our app as set in the <code>package.json</code> file, and various environment and process info.</p> <p>Then it replies to the request in the format specified by Slack in their docs. We use the line <code>text: JSON.stringify(stats, null, '\\t')</code> to turn our info and stats object into a nicely formatted text string, in the style of a JSON object. </p> <p>Then, in the line <code>return res.json(response);</code>, we return all the info back to Slack to display as the response to a matching slash command. </p> <p>Great, now we can commit and push this code. </p> <pre><code>git commit -am 'added handler for slash command'\ngit push origin \n</code></pre> <p>After the code has finished deploying on Code Capsules (it should send a startup message again when it's ready), we can test the slash command. </p> <p>Type <code>/stats</code> in the channel we chose earlier. After a second or two, the app should respond with its current vital stats and information. </p> <p></p>","title":"Adding a slash command"},{"location":"tutorials/build-slackbot-with-node/#adding-verification","text":"<p>We can ask our app via Slack (which we use constantly!) how it's doing; pretty cool, huh? There is a problem though. If we call our slash command endpoint from anywhere else, for instance if we just call it using Postman, it also returns all the information and stats! This would not be good for a production system, as sensitive information will be easily found by attackers. </p> <p></p> <p>So how can we ensure that the request comes from our Slack workspace? Luckily, Slack has thought about this, and sends a message signature with its requests. From the guide in Slack's docs, we can put together some code to check that the request is legitimately from Slack. The main parts of the check, copied from the docs, looks like this: </p>  <ul> <li>Retrieve the X-Slack-Request-Timestamp header on the HTTP request, and the body of the request.</li> <li>Concatenate the version number, the timestamp, and the body of the request to form a basestring. Use a colon as the delimiter between the three elements. For example, v0:123456789:command=/weather&amp;text=94070. The version number right now is always v0.</li> <li>With the help of HMAC SHA256 implemented in your favorite programming language, hash the above basestring, using the Slack Signing Secret as the key.</li> <li>Compare this computed signature to the X-Slack-Signature header on the request.</li> </ul>  <p>We can also check the timestamp to ensure that it is not a replay attack of a message from long ago. </p> <p>Ok, let's implement this in our project. First, we somehow need to access the raw body of the request, before it has been parsed by <code>body-parser</code>. This is to ensure that the signing hash we calculate is using the same data that Slack did. After parsing, there could be extra characters and formatting etc. Luckily, the body parser package has a verify option, which passes a binary buffer of the raw body request to a user defined function. Let's make a function that conforms to the specs given by <code>body-parser</code>. Add this code to your <code>index.js</code> file: </p> <pre><code>var rawBodySaver = function (req, res, buf, encoding) {\n  if (buf &amp;&amp; buf.length) {\n    req.rawBody = buf.toString(encoding || 'utf8');\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In this function, we grab the bit stream buffer <code>buf</code>, and check that it is not null and that it is not empty (by checking that it has a length). Then we tack it onto the request <code>req</code> as a new property <code>rawBody</code>. We also convert the buffer to a string, using the encoding supplied, or fall back to <code>utf8</code> as a default. Now that the <code>rawBody</code> is added to the request, it will be available for use by subsequent middleware. We can add it to the body parser by modifying the code where we add the body parser to the app. </p> <pre><code>app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ verify: rawBodySaver}));\n</code></pre> <p>In the code above, we added options to our body parser initialisation. We set the <code>verify</code> option to the method we added above. </p> <p>Now, let's make a new middleware function to calculate the signature and compare it. We'll be able to call this middleware before our current code for responding to our Slack slash command. Making it a middleware function will also allow us to easily re-use it on other routes, if we want to add more slash commands, or other commands from Slack in the future. We'll make a new file to hold this code. We'll call it <code>signing.js</code>. </p> <p>In the new file, let's add this code:</p> <pre><code>const crypto = require('crypto');\n\nfunction checkSlackMessageSignature(req, res, next){\n    const timestamp = req.headers['x-slack-request-timestamp']; \n    const fiveMinutesAgo = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) - (60 * 5);\n\n    if (timestamp &lt; fiveMinutesAgo) {\n        return res.sendFail(401, \"mismatched timestamp\");\n    }\n\n    const signing_secret = process.env.SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET; \n\n    const slack_signature = req.headers['x-slack-signature']; \n    const [version, slack_hash] = slack_signature.split('=');\n\n    const sig_basestring = version + ':' + timestamp + ':' + req.rawBody;\n    const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', signing_secret); \n    hmac.update(sig_basestring); \n    const our_hash = hmac.digest('hex');    \n\n    if (crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(slack_hash), Buffer.from(our_hash))) {\n        return next(); \n    }\n    else {\n        return res.send(401, \"Invalid request signature\");\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = checkSlackMessageSignature; \n</code></pre> <p>Let's take a look at this code. Firstly, we import the crypto (cryptography) library. We don't need to install this as a package, as it is built into Node.js. This library will allow us to perform the hash of the basestring to compare with the signature. </p> <p>Next, we create a function, with the standard Express middleware parameters: - <code>req</code>, representing the request data. - <code>res</code>, representing an output object that we return results to the user via. - <code>next</code>, representing a function to call if we want to hand control to the next middleware function in the chain. It can also be used to pass an error object back up if something goes wrong processing the request.</p> <p>Then, on the first few lines of the function, we get the timestamp Slack sends from the request headers, and check that it is within the last few minutes. Note the name of the header is all in lowercase, even though Slack specifies that the header is capitalised. This is because Express converts all header keys to lowercase when serving a request. </p> <p>After that, we retrieve the Slack Signing Secret from our environment variables. Let's get our Signing Secret from Slack and add it to the Code Capsules environment now. Head over to your Slack app dashboard, and click on \"Basic Information\" in the left-hand sidebar. Then scroll down to App Credentials, and look for the Signing Secret. Click \"Show\", and copy the secret. </p> <p></p> <p>Now head over to your Capsule on Code Capsules, and click on the Config tab. Add a new environment variable with Name <code>SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET</code> and paste in the value of the Signing Secret we copied above. Click \"Update &amp; Start Build\" to save the changes. </p> <p></p> <p>Ok, back to the function. After we retrieve the signing secret from the environment variables, we read out the hash calculated and sent by Slack from the headers using <code>const slack_signature = req.headers['x-slack-signature']</code>. This will be a string that looks something like <code>v0=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</code>, where the <code>xxxx</code> represents the actual hash value. We need to split the version identifier <code>v0</code> from the beginning of the string though, as this is not part of the hash value. We do this in the next line, <code>const [version, slack_hash] = slack_signature.split('=')</code>. Now we have both the version, and the hash string in variables that we can access. </p> <p>After this, we construct our basestring, made from the version we extracted above, the timestamp of the request, and the <code>rawBody</code> (which we extracted in our body parser <code>verify</code> function earlier). </p> <p>The next two lines are where we actually calculate the hash. First, we set up the <code>crypto</code> module with our crypto algorithm type <code>SHA256</code>, and with our unique Signing Secret. This allows us to then create an HMAC \u2013 or Hash Based Message Authentication code, which is the fancy name for the message signature. We then use the <code>update</code> method on our newly created HMAC to load in our basestring that we constructed above. </p> <p>Now that the crypto HMAC is primed with all the info it needs, we can call the <code>digest</code> function to actually calculate the hash. We pass in as a parameter <code>hex</code> to indicate that we want the result back in hexadecimal format, as this is the same format that Slack sends their calculated hash value in. </p> <p>Great, so now we have Slack's signature hash, and our hash. We need to check that they are the same, which will prove that the message was legitimately sent by Slack. We could just use a normal string compare, i.e. <code>if (slack_hash === our_hash)</code>, but there is a slight security issue with this, known as a timing attack. This type of attack is based on the knowledge that a normal string compare function takes a different amount of time to compare two strings, depending on how close the strings are to each other. An attacker can take advantage of this timing difference to repeatedly send messages and, based on the time for our server to respond, can guess at how close their hash is to what we are expecting. With much patience and many thousands of messages, an attacker could eventually guess our Signing Secret, compromising all our checks. </p> <p>Luckily, there is a simple way to protect from this, and it's built right into the <code>crypto</code> library. This is where we call <code>crypto.timingSafeEqual</code>. This compare always returns in the same amount of time, regardless of how close the hashes are to each other. Therefore, we don't give any extra information away to would-be attackers. </p> <p>Now, if the hashes are equal, from our <code>timingSafeEqual</code> test, we just call <code>return next()</code> which exits our function and passes control to the next middleware function (which will be our slash command handler). </p> <p>If the hashes are not equal, then we know this request is not genuinely from Slack, so we can end early and send a <code>401</code>, which is a standard HTTP code for <code>Unauthorized</code>. Basically, we boot the imposter out. </p> <p>Now, the last line in this file is <code>module.exports = checkSlackMessageSignature</code>. This allows our middleware function to be visible to other modules that import this file. </p> <p>Ok, now that we've got this middleware created, let's link it to our slash command handler. Head on back to the <code>index.js</code> file, and import the middleware function by adding this line near the top of the file: </p> <pre><code>const checkSlackMessageSignature = require('./signing'); \n</code></pre> <p>Now, we can navigate to our slack command handler, which started like this: <code>app.post('/slack/command/stats'</code>. Modify that to include a call to the message signature check before the actual handler, like this: </p> <pre><code>app.post('/slack/command/stats', [checkSlackMessageSignature, function(req,res){\n</code></pre> <p>Fantastic, now our app is secure. You can commit all the changes, and push it up to Git, which will kick off our final deploy to Code Capsules: </p> <pre><code>git add . \ngit commit -am 'added message signature checking'\ngit push origin\n</code></pre> <p>Once the code is up and running on Code Capsules, test it out to see that it still responds to the Slack slash command. Then you can try again from Postman or other similar apps, and see that it will not send any info without a valid signature (you can use <code>v0=a2114d57b48eac39b9ad189dd8316235a7b4a8d21a10bd27519666489c69b503</code> as an example <code>x-slack-signature</code> parameter): </p> <p></p>","title":"Adding verification"},{"location":"tutorials/build-slackbot-with-node/#things-to-try-next","text":"<p>What else can we do?

The current temperature in Cape Town is: '+str(curr_temp)+\" celsius.\"\n\n\ndef return_rates():\n    return \"Hello. Today, USD conversion rates are as follows: USD-&gt;CAD = \"+str(cad_rate)+\", USD-&gt;EUR = \"+str(eur_rate)+\", USD-&gt;ZAR = \"+str(zar_rate)\n</code></pre> <p>Now, replace the <code>return_weather()</code> and <code>return_rates()</code> function calls with the code below:</p> <pre><code>def main():\n    TOKEN = \"YOUR-BOT-TOKEN-HERE\"\n    updater = Updater(token=TOKEN, use_context=True)\n    dispatcher = updater.dispatcher\n\n    weather_handler = CommandHandler(\"weather\", weather)\n    currency_handler = CommandHandler(\"currency\", currency)\n    start_handler = CommandHandler(\"start\", start)\n\n    dispatcher.add_handler(weather_handler)\n    dispatcher.add_handler(currency_handler)\n    dispatcher.add_handler(start_handler)\n\n    updater.start_polling()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n</code></pre> <p>At the top of our new <code>main</code> method, which will be called when this file is run, we instantiate <code>updater</code>, an instance of the Telegram library's <code>Updater</code> class. This object will retrieve commands sent to our bot and pass them to an instance of the <code>Dispatcher</code> class. We've assigned this <code>Dispatcher</code> instance to the variable <code>dispatcher</code> for further use.</p> <p>Next, we create three different <code>CommandHandler</code> classes, one for each command that can be sent to our bot: <code>/start</code>, <code>/weather</code> and <code>/currency</code>. We pass two arguments into each instantiation: the command text (without the preceding <code>/</code>), and a function to call. For example, when a user enters the command <code>/weather</code>, the <code>weather()</code> function will be called.</p> <p>Let's define that function, and the other two. Just above <code>def main()</code>, enter the following three function definitions. </p> <pre><code>def weather(update, context):\n    context.bot.send_message(chat_id=update.effective_chat.id, text=return_weather())\n\ndef currency(update, context):\n    context.bot.send_message(chat_id=update.effective_chat.id, text=return_rates())\n\ndef start(update, context):\n    context.bot.send_message(chat_id=update.effective_chat.id, text=\"Hi! I respond to /weather and /currency. Try them!\")\n</code></pre> <p>Each of these functions calls the <code>python-telegram-bot</code> function <code>send_message()</code> with the ID of the current chat and the appropriate text, either returned from one of our other functions or specified as a string. The <code>update</code> and <code>context</code> arguments are supplied automatically by the dispatcher.</p> <p>Back in our <code>main()</code> function, we use <code>dispatch.add_handler</code> to add all three handlers to our dispatcher.</p> <p>Finally, <code>updater.start_polling()</code> will begin polling for updates from Telegram. This means our code will regularly ask Telegram's servers if any commands have been sent to it. Upon receiving commands, the appropriate handler will be invoked. In the next section, we'll discuss the pitfalls of polling and consider an alternative.</p> <p>The code <code>bot.py</code> file should now look like the code below.

This <code>User</code> class will contain information pertaining to the user that is currently logged in to our sleep tracker.</p> <p>Flask Login expects us to implement four methods in our <code>User</code> class: <code>is_authenticated</code>, <code>is_active</code>, <code>is_anonymous</code> and <code>get_id</code>. Rather than implementing all of these ourselves, we will have our <code>User</code> class inherit from Flask's <code>UserMixin</code>, which provides generic implementations for the first three, leaving us with only <code>get_id</code>. In addition, we'll need to implement our own <code>load_user</code> and <code>check_password</code> methods.</p> <p>Below the line <code>db = client.user_login</code>, enter the following code:</p> <pre><code>class User(UserMixin):\n    def __init__(self, username):\n        self.username = username\n\n    def get_id(self):\n        return self.username\n</code></pre> <p>Here we've created the class, inherited from <code>UserMixin</code> and implemented the <code>get_id</code> method, which simply returns the user's username. To facilitate user login, we need to implement two methods, <code>load_user</code> and <code>check_password</code>. Let's implement <code>load_user</code> first. This method will be used to fetch a user from the MongoDB database corresponding to the username entered in the login form. Add the following code to the <code>User</code> class:</p> <pre><code>    @login_manager.user_loader\n    def load_user(username):\n        user = db.users.find_one({ \"username\": username })\n        if user is None:\n            return None\n        return User(username=user['username'])\n</code></pre> <p>The decorate <code>@login_manager.user_loader</code> tells the <code>login_manager</code> to use this method to load users.</p> <p>Now let's add a <code>check_password</code> method. This method will be called to determine whether a user has entered the correct password for the username they specify. When we register users, we will hash their passwords with the bcrypt one-way encryption function before storing them in MongoDB. This will keep our users' passwords secret from us and, should our application be compromised in future, ensure that hackers cannot easily recover our users' passwords and use them on other websites those users may have account on. Therefore, when checking the password a user has entered on login, we need to hash this input with bcrypt before comparing it to the password entry in our MongoDB database. To do this, add the following code to the <code>User</code> class:</p> <pre><code>    @staticmethod\n    def check_password(password_entered, password):\n        if bcrypt.check_password_hash(password, password_entered):\n            return True\n        return False\n</code></pre> <p>By making <code>check_password</code> a static method, we enabled it to be called without instantiating an instance of our <code>User</code> class.</p> <p>That's all we need for user login. Now we need to link our login and registration form to this functionality. </p>","title":"Create the user class"},{"location":"tutorials/develop-persistent-sleep-tracker-part-1/#add-functionality-to-the-login-and-register-buttons","text":"<p>When a user clicks the register button, we will create a new user document in our MongoDB users collection, containing their username and hashed password. When a user clicks \"Login\", we will log them in if they've entered a valid username and password combination and redirect them to the <code>main.html</code> file. </p> <p>To do this, we'll create a new function that handles login and registration. Add the following code below the <code>def login()</code> function:</p> <pre><code>@app.route(\"/\", methods = [\"POST\"])\ndef login_or_register():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        name_entered = str(request.form.get('user_name')) # Get username and password from form\n        pw_entered = str(request.form.get('user_pw'))\n\n        if request.form.get('login'): # Log in logic\n            user = db.users.find_one({ 'username': name_entered })\n            if user and User.check_password(pw_entered, user['password']):\n                usr_obj = User(username=user['username'])\n                login_user(usr_obj)\n                return redirect(url_for('main'))\n            else:\n                return \"Incorrect username or password.\"\n\n        elif request.form.get('register'): # Register logic\n            # Validate username and password\n            if not re.match(\"[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,20}\", name_entered):\n                return \"Username must be between 1 and 20 characters.

As mentioned when we created our <code>login.html</code> file, using a <code>POST</code> method for user login and registration allows our application to transmit username and information more securely and allows us to differentiate between a user login or registration (<code>POST</code>) and a user merely visiting the page (<code>GET</code>).</p> <p>If the login button is pressed (<code>if request.form.get('login')</code>), we check our MongoDB for a username that matches the one entered. Then we check if the password entered matches that user's password in the MongoDB. If <code>check_password</code> evaluates to true, we log the user in and redirect to the <code>main</code> route (which we'll create in the next part of this series. Otherwise, we provide the user with an error message. To redirect users, we use Flask's <code>redirect</code> function and <code>url_for</code> functions. The <code>url_for</code> function finds the <code>main</code> route, and the <code>redirect</code> function sends users to that route. </p> <p>If a user clicks \"Register\", we first validate the username and password they've provided. We're restricting usernames to a length of 20 characters, containing only alphanumeric characters and underscores. We're also ensuring that the chosen password is eight or more characters long. We then check whether the username they're trying to use is already taken. If their username and password are acceptable, we create a <code>new_user</code> dictionary with the specified name and a bcrypt hash of the specified password, which we then insert it into our MongoDB. Then we send the user back to the login page.</p>","title":"Add functionality to the login and register buttons"},{"location":"tutorials/develop-persistent-sleep-tracker-part-1/#trying-out-the-login-system","text":"<p>We've implemented the login and register buttons.

If a user has clicked the button, we'll set this line to \"True\" and a graph with the user's sleep data will display. </p> <p>Now, we can implement the functionality for our \"Submit\", \"View Graph\" and \"Logout\" buttons.

If either value does not pass validation, we return a relevant error message from the function without writing to the database. Otherwise we continue.</p> <p>If a user has never entered any sleep data, we add a new <code>'date'</code> and <code>'time'</code> entry to the user's MongoDB entry with the date and time entered. Otherwise, we take the data they entered and add it to their existing sleep data. Finally, we update the user's MongoDB entry with <code>db.users.update_one</code>. </p> <p>We've implemented functionality for all three buttons. Now we need to modify the <code>main()</code> function to pass the current user's data to <code>main.html</code>. This will allow us to display their username on the page, and to graph their sleep data. Find the <code>main()</code> function and modify it like so:</p> <pre><code>@app.route('/main')\ndef main():\n    if current_user.get_id() is None:\n        return redirect(url_for('login')) # redirect to login page if not logged in\n\n    user_data = db.users.find_one({ 'username': current_user.get_id() })\n    return render_template(\"main.html\", user=user_data, plot=app.config['plotting'])\n</code></pre> <p>First, we leverage Flask-Login's anonymous users functionality to check if the current user is not logged in and, if so, we redirect them to the login page. If the current user is logged it, we retrieve their MongoDB entry and assign it to <code>user_data</code>. Then we pass this variable to the <code>render_template</code> function as <code>user</code>. This is how the line below will access and display the user's name.</p> <pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;Hey, {{ user['username'] }}! Let's track your sleep.&lt;/h2&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>As <code>user_data</code> contains the entire MongoDB user entry, our template will be able to access the current user's sleep data from the <code>user</code> variable as well.</p> <p>We've also passed the template the value of <code>app.config['plotting']</code> in <code>plot</code>. This is how our application will know whether or not to display a graph on the <code>/main</code> page. </p> <p>All that's left now is to add the sleep data graph in our <code>main.html</code> file.

We write a boot message to the console, just so we can see when the code runs in the logs. Then we can create a new connection to the database, using the connection string that was automatically added to the <code>DATABASE_URL</code> environment variable when we bound the capsules. Then we use the <code>execute</code> function to send a SQL command to the database. The SQL command creates a new table with the columns defined above. It has a callback to let us know if the operation is a success or if it has an error. In both cases, we write the output to the console, so we'll be able to see what happened when we read the logs. </p> <p>Now, we need a way for the Backend Capsule to run this setup script. We can use the <code>package.json</code> file to register a new command that <code>npm</code> will be able to run.

Let's add some code to create an API route to read from this table. </p> <p>To keep the solution neater, we'll add a new file to contain the API route code. Add a new file called <code>games.js</code> in the <code>routes</code> folder in your project, with the following code:</p> <p><pre><code>var express = require('express');\nconst mysql = require('mysql2');\n\nvar router = express.Router();\n\nconst connection = mysql.createConnection(process.env.DATABASE_URL);\n\nrouter.get('/', function(req, res, next){\n\n  connection.query(\n    `SELECT * FROM games`,\n    queryResults\n  ); \n\n  function queryResults(err, results, fields){\n    if (err) return next(err); \n    return res.json(results); \n  }\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router;\n</code></pre> This code imports the Express module so that we can construct a <code>router</code>, and the <code>mysql2</code> module so that we can connect to the database. </p> <p>We create a <code>router</code>, which is an object that allows us to group routes and middleware together logically. We'll add all our CRUD routes to this router object. Then we create a new database connection, as we did in our setup script. </p> <p>Express routers allow us to add routes using the following structure:</p> <pre><code>router.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)\n</code></pre> <p><code>METHOD</code> is one of the standard HTTP request methods to use. <code>PATH</code> is the relative part of the server URL to get to the route, and <code>HANDLER</code> is a function that we want run when the route is accessed. </p> <p>To create the read route, we use the HTTP <code>GET</code> verb, which can be configured using the <code>get</code> method on the router. Since we need no parameters, we set the path to <code>/</code>. Then we add our handler function. The function accepts 3 arguments from the Express router: </p> <ul> <li><code>req</code>, which is all the incoming request parameters and context from the client.</li> <li><code>res</code>, a results object where we can specify how to return data to the client.</li> <li><code>next</code>, a function that we can call to hand control to the next middleware in our route, if there is any. If we want to signal an error, we can pass an argument to <code>next</code>, and Express will return an error to the client with the data in that argument. </li> </ul> <p>In our <code>get</code> handler, we run a SQL query to select all entries from the database. The <code>query</code> method takes a SQL query and a callback function. This callback is called with the results or error from the SQL server. We use a separate named function as our callback. This is mainly a stylistic choice - we could write the function inline, but our code would be less readable, as it would have many indentations and creep to the right-hand side of the screen. </p> <p>In the callback, we check if the <code>err</code>, or error, parameter is set. If it is, we use the <code>next</code> function along with the error to exit the route early. This will send an error message to the client. </p> <p>If there is no error, we send the results of the SQL query back, formatted as JSON. </p> <p>Now that we have the router set up and our first route created, we can hook them up to the main Express app. Open the <code>app.js</code> file in the route folder and add the following code above the line <code>var app = express();</code>:</p> <pre><code>var gamesRouter = require('./routes/games');\n</code></pre> <p>This adds a reference to the router we defined in the <code>game.js</code> file. </p> <p>Now, let's use this reference to add the router to the Express app. Add the following line just above the <code>module.exports = app;</code>: </p> <pre><code>app.use('/games', [ gamesRouter ]); \n</code></pre> <p>This mounts the route at the path <code>/games</code> on our server. </p> <p>Let's test all of this by committing and pushing these changes:</p> <pre><code>git add . \ngit commit -am 'added get route for games'\ngit push origin\n</code></pre> <p>If you visit the Code Capsules dashboard for the Backend Capsule, you should see a note that it's building. Once it's finished building, head over to your site in a browser and navigate to the <code>/games</code> route. You should see it return an empty array:</p> <p></p> <p>This works, but is not very interesting! Let's add a create route so that we can add new game entries. </p>","title":"Adding a Read Route"},{"location":"tutorials/game-catalogue-with-nodejs-and-mysql/#adding-a-create-route","text":"<p>We'll use the HTTP POST method as the verb for creating a new game in the catalogue. </p> <p>For the create route, it would be nice to return the newly created entry, along with the id automatically created by MySQL for the entry. To do this, we'll first need to <code>INSERT</code> the new data into the database, and then run a <code>SELECT</code> command to retrieve the fully created database object. We can use the concept of \"middleware\" in Express to achieve this. </p> <p>Each route allows us to chain multiple handlers to it, with each handler running one after the other. This is the core concept of middleware. So to implement our create route with its two distinct operations, we can chain 2 handlers, like this: </p> <pre><code>router.post('/', [functionOne, functionTwo])\n</code></pre> <p>Here, <code>functionOne</code> can pass control to <code>functionTwo</code> by calling the <code>next()</code> parameter, which is passed into each handler by Express. We can also pass custom information from one handler to another by adding it onto the <code>req</code> object, which is also passed to each handler by Express.</p> <p>Ok, enough theory, let's add this code in <code>games.js</code> above the line <code>module.exports = router;</code> using what we know from above:</p> <pre><code>router.post('/', [addNewGame, returnGameById]);  \n\n\nfunction addNewGame(req, res, next){\n  connection.query(\n    `INSERT INTO games\n      (title, platform, year)\n      VALUES (?, ?, ?)`, \n      [req.body.title, req.body.platform, req.body.year],\n    queryResults\n  );\n\n  function queryResults(err, results, fields){\n    if (err) return next(err); \n    req.body.id = results.insertId\n    return next(); \n  }\n}\n\nfunction returnGameById(req, res, done){\n  connection.query(`\n    SELECT * FROM games\n    WHERE id = ?\n    `,\n    [req.body.id],\n    queryResults\n  ); \n\n  function queryResults(err, results, fields){\n    if (err) return next(err); \n    return res.json(results); \n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We've implemented each of the handlers as separate, named functions. You could implement both as inline functions, but again, it's a stylistic choice to improve readability. Also, by writing each handler as a named function, the list of the functions passed to the router is almost self-documenting, telling us the steps the route takes. Lastly, we can also re-use each of the handlers in other routes if we need to. </p> <p>The first handler, <code>addNewGame</code>, uses a SQL <code>INSERT</code> query to create a new database row. Note the <code>?</code> placeholders in the query. This feature of the MySQL2 package allows us to pass in arguments to the query, instead of concating the query with our incoming values. The values passed in from the client can be found on the <code>req.body</code> object, neatly parsed into JSON by Express. We can pass these values in an array as an argument to the query function. The function will substitute each <code>?</code> for a value, in the order that they are passed in the array. We use a function <code>queryResults</code> as we did for the <code>get</code> route, as our callback. Note here that the <code>results</code> parameter on this occasion will have an object of stats and information on the <code>INSERT</code> operation. One of the fields is <code>insertId</code>, which is the automatically assigned <code>id</code> of the new record in the database. We add this to the <code>req.body</code> object, and then call <code>next()</code> to pass control to the next handler, <code>returnGameById</code>. </p> <p>The handler <code>returnGameById</code> queries the database for the newly created object, using the <code>id</code> field we added to the <code>req.body</code> object in the first handler. In the callback for the query, <code>queryResults</code>, we return the database row as a JSON object, using the <code>res.json</code> method. </p> <p>To test this, commit and push the code up again to Code Capsules.</p> <pre><code>git add . \ngit commit -am 'added post route for games'\ngit push origin\n</code></pre> <p>Once it has successfully built and deployed on Code Capsules, we can try this new route out. To do this, download Postman, which is a tool that makes it easier to interact with APIs. </p> <p>Create a new query in Postman, with the HTTP method set to \"POST\". Set the URL to the URL of your Backend Capsule, along with the <code>/games</code> path. Then click the \"Body\" tab, select \"raw\" as the mime type, and select \"JSON\" from the dropdown as the content type. </p> <p>Add the following JSON payload to the body:</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"title\" : \"Super Mario Brothers\", \n    \"platform\" : \"NES\",\n    \"year\" : 1985\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Click \"Send\", and your API should send back the newly inserted game, along with its <code>id</code>:</p> <p></p>","title":"Adding a Create Route"},{"location":"tutorials/game-catalogue-with-nodejs-and-mysql/#adding-an-update-route","text":"<p>Now that we can add a game, and read back the catalogue, we might need to update an entry if we find an entry has a mistake.

In the <code>app.js</code> file, add the following near the top of the file, just under the other package <code>require</code> statements: </p> <pre><code>const passport = require('passport');  \nconst BasicStrategy = require('passport-http').BasicStrategy; \n</code></pre> <p>We'll need a place to store the user credentials, so we can check them against the credentials the client supplies. We can store them in the environment settings, as they'll be stored in plain text, i.e. unencrypted. In a production application, you would store them in the database, with the password hashed and salted. We'll leave that option as something for you to explore :). </p> <p>Head over to the \"Config\" page on your Backend Capsule, and add 2 new environment variables : <code>USERNAME</code> and <code>PASSWORD</code>. Supply values of your own to set your username and password, and click <code>Update Capsule</code> when you are done.  </p> <p></p> <p>Now we can add the Passport code to check incoming credentials against these stored credentials. Add this code just above the <code>var gamesRouter = require('./routes/games');</code> line in <code>app.js</code>:</p> <pre><code>passport.use(new BasicStrategy(\n  function(username, password, done) {\n    if (username === process.env.USERNAME &amp;&amp; password === process.env.PASSWORD){\n      return done(null, {username: process.env.USERNAME }); \n    }\n    else {\n      return done(null, false); \n    }\n  })\n);\n</code></pre> <p>This sets up Passport to use the \"basic\" strategy for authentication. We supply a callback function which checks the incoming credentials against the credentials in the environment variables. If they match, we call the Passport <code>done()</code> function, with the a simple user object containing the user name. If there is no match, we call the <code>done()</code> function with <code>false</code> to signal that we found no match for the user. </p> <p>The final part is to add the Passport authenticate middleware to the routes we want to protect. We'll add it to all our game routes. </p> <p>Update the line:  <pre><code>app.use('/games', [gamesRouter]); \n</code></pre></p> <p>to: </p> <pre><code>app.use('/games', [passport.authenticate('basic', {session: false}), gamesRouter]); \n</code></pre> <p>We set the <code>session</code> flag to false, as the convention for APIs is to require credentials to be passed with every request, i.e. no session cookies are used. </p> <p>Commit and push this updated code to deploy it. Once it is running, if you try any of the routes in Postman, you should see an authentication error message. </p> <p></p> <p>To send the credentials along with your request, select the \"Authorisation\" tab in Postman. Choose \"Basic Auth\" from the dropdown list, and enter the credentials you set in the right-hand pane.</p> <p></p> <p>If you try your query again, it should let you pass, and come back with the usual response. </p> <p></p>","title":"Adding Authentication"},{"location":"tutorials/game-catalogue-with-nodejs-and-mysql/#next-steps","text":"<p>Now that you've built an HTTP REST CRUD API, here are a couple more things to try: </p> <ul> <li>Add more routes.

To do this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create a new directory named <code>static</code> in the <code>project</code> directory.</p> </li> <li> <p>Navigate to the <code>templates</code> directory and then the <code>dist</code> directory.</p> </li> <li> <p>Copy all of the directories located in <code>dist</code> into the <code>static</code> directory that we created above.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Your <code>project</code> file structure should look like this:</p> <pre><code>project\n    static\n      css\n        + style.css\n      images\n        + iphone-mockup.png\n      js\n        + main.min.js\n    templates\n</code></pre> <p>This was necessary because Flask strictly serves CSS, JavaScript, and images from the <code>static</code> directory, and renders HTML files in the <code>templates</code> directory. Because we've moved our template's files around, we now need to edit our <code>index.html</code> file to point to their new locations.</p> <p>Flask uses the Jinja templating library to allow us to embed backend code in HTML. This code will be executed on the webserver before a given page is served to the user, allowing us to give that page dynamic functionality and make it responsive to user input.</p> <p>The first thing we will use Jinja templating for is to dynamically locate and load our <code>index.html</code> file's stylesheet. Open the <code>index.html</code> file in the <code>templates</code> folder and find this line:</p> <pre><code>&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"dist/css/style.css\"&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Replace the value of <code>href</code> with the string below.</p> <pre><code>&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{url_for('static',filename='css/style.css')}}\"&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>In Jinja, anything between <code>{{</code> and <code>}}</code> is server-side code that will be evaluated before the page is served to users, i.e. when it is rendered. In this way, we can include the output of Python functions and the values of Python variables in our HTML. Jinja syntax is similar to Python, but not identical.</p> <p>In the Jinja code above, we're calling the function <code>url_for()</code>, which asks Flask to find the location of our <code>style.css</code> file in our <code>static</code> directory.</p> <p>Speaking of Flask, we're almost ready to implement our functionality.</p>","title":"Project directory restructuring"},{"location":"tutorials/stripe-checkout-and-email-with-flask/#setting-up-the-virtual-environment","text":"<p>We'll create a virtual environment for our project.
