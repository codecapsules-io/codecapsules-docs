# How Do I Add/Remove Teams?

You can create as many teams as you need on Code Capsules. To create a new Team, click on the yellow `+` button on the bottom left of the screen.

## Removing Teams

To remove a Team, go to the "Details" tab in your Team dashboard and select "Remove Team." Note that all Spaces within the Team must be removed before you can remove the Team itself.
