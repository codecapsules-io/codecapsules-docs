# What Is a Team?

![Teams contain Spaces and Spaces contain Capsules](../.gitbook/assets/platform/shared/teamspacecapsule.png)

Teams, [Spaces](../spaces/what-is-a-space.md), and [Capsules](../capsules/what-is-a-capsule.md) form the foundation of [Code Capsules](https://codecapsules.io).

A **Team** is a group of developers who share access to the same [Spaces](../spaces/what-is-a-space.md) and [Capsules](../capsules/what-is-a-capsule.md) for easy collaboration.

Each Team is linked to a payment method, and the associated credit card is billed when charges are incurred.
