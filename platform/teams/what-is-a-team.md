# What Is a Team?

![Teams contain Spaces and Spaces contain Capsules](../.gitbook/assets/platform/shared/teamspacecapsule.png)

Teams, [Spaces](../spaces/what-is-a-space.md), and [Capsules](../capsules/what-is-a-capsule.md) are the foundation of [Code Capsules](https://codecapsules.io).

A **Team** is a group of developers who share access to the same [Spaces](../spaces/what-is-a-space.md), and [Capsules](../capsules/what-is-a-capsule.md) in order to make collaborative development easier.

Furthermore, Teams are associated with a payment method â€“ you add a credit card to a Team, and Code Capsules bills this credit card when a charge incurs.
