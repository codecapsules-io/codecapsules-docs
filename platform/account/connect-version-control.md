# How Do I Connect to a Version Control Provider?

To deploy applications on Code Capsules, you need to connect to a version control provider and give Code Capsules permission to read the relevant repository.

To connect your Code Capsules account to your version control provider, navigate to **Repos** in the dashboard and click **Install** next to your preferred provider.

Follow the prompts to give Code Capsules access to your repos. 

For example, to connect to GitHub, select your GitHub username and set the following options in the dialog:

1. Enable **Only Select Repositories**.
2. Select the GitHub repository you want to deploy from.
3. Click **Install & Authorize**.

Once version control is connected, you can [share repos with your Teams](../teams/share-a-repo-with-a-team.md).
