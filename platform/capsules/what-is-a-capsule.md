# What is a Capsule?

![Teams contain Spaces and Spaces contain Capsules](../.gitbook/assets/platform/shared/teamspacecapsule.png)

[Teams](../teams/what-is-a-team.md), [Spaces](../spaces/what-is-a-space.md), and Capsules are the foundation of [Code Capsules](https://codecapsules.io).

**Capsules** provide the actual computational power for running your applications. While Teams and Spaces are organizational tools, Capsules connect to GitHub repositories containing your applications and hosts them on a server. Capsules can run both frontend and backend applications.

Capsules automatically build and deploy upon creation. One can monitor the build process by navigating to the "Logs" tab, or by pressing "View build log" under the "Build and Deploy" tab.

Upon deployment, an HTTPS subdomain is generated for the Capsule. The subdomain assigned to the app is available in the "Config" tab. Clicking on the subdomain will open the link in a new tab.

You can turn Capsules off by toggling the switch at the top right of the Capsule view (next to "Live Website").
