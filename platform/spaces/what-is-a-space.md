# What Is a Space?

![Teams contain Spaces and Spaces contain Capsules](..//.gitbook/assets/platform/shared/teamspacecapsule.png)

[Teams](../teams/what-is-a-team.md), Spaces, and [Capsules](../capsules/what-is-a-capsule.md) are the foundation of [Code Capsules](https://codecapsules.io). 

**Spaces** are an organizational tool for [Capsules](../capsules/what-is-a-capsule.md). Each Space can contain any number of Capsules. Spaces come in handy when working with a large project â€“ it may be useful to split the project into multiple Capsules.
