# What Is a Space?

![Teams contain Spaces and Spaces contain Capsules](../.gitbook/assets/platform/shared/teamspacecapsule.png)

[Teams](../teams/what-is-a-team.md), Spaces, and [Capsules](../capsules/what-is-a-capsule.md) form the foundation of [Code Capsules](https://codecapsules.io). 

A **Space** is an organizational tool for managing [Capsules](../capsules/what-is-a-capsule.md). Each Space can contain multiple Capsules, making it easier to structure and manage large or complex projects by grouping related Capsules together.
