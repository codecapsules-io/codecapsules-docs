# Best Practices for Structuring MEAN/MERN/MEVN Projects

### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

The MEAN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js—is a powerful technology suite that enables developers to build robust and scalable web applications. Adhering to best practices in structuring your MEAN project can have a significant impact on maintainability and scalability. In this article, we’ll delve into some of these practices to guide you towards a more organized and efficient development process.

### MEAN Stack Overview <a href="#mean-stack-overview" id="mean-stack-overview"></a>

The MEAN stack combines the following technologies:

* MongoDB: A NoSQL database.
* Express.js: A back-end framework running on Node.js.
* Angular: A front-end framework.
* Node.js: The JavaScript runtime for server-side code.

Together, these components provide an end-to-end framework for building web applications in JavaScript and TypeScript.

### MERN Stack Overview <a href="#mern-stack-overview" id="mern-stack-overview"></a>

The MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js—is another popular JavaScript technology stack. Similar to MEAN, it provides an end-to-end framework for web development, with React as its front-end library.

### MEVN Stack Overview <a href="#mevn-stack-overview" id="mevn-stack-overview"></a>

The MEVN stack, consisting of MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, and Node.js, provides an alternative to both MEAN and MERN stacks. It leverages Vue.js for front-end development and retains MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js for the back-end.

### Project Structure <a href="#project-structure" id="project-structure"></a>

Let’s start by discussing how to ideally structure your MEAN stack project. Below is an example directory layout:

Copy

```
    my-mean-app/
    ├── client/             
    ├── server/             
    ├── config/             
    ├── scripts/            
    ├── package.json        
    └── README.md           
```

This separation of client and server code can help maintain a clean code base, making it easier for developers to navigate through the project.

### Folder By Feature vs. Folder By Type <a href="#folder-by-feature-vs-folder-by-type" id="folder-by-feature-vs-folder-by-type"></a>

There are mainly two strategies when it comes to organizing code: “Folder by Feature” and “Folder by Type.”

#### Folder By Feature

Copy

```
    server/
    ├── users/                  
    │   ├── user.model.js       
    │   ├── user.controller.js  
    │   └── user.routes.js      
    ├── products/               
    │   ├── product.model.js    
    │   ├── product.controller.js 
    │   └── product.routes.js   
    └── ...
```

Here, each feature (like users, products, etc.) has its own directory that contains all related models, controllers, and routes. This can be particularly useful in larger projects.

#### Folder By Type

Copy

```
    server/
    ├── models/                 
    │   ├── user.model.js       
    │   └── product.model.js    
    ├── controllers/            
    │   ├── user.controller.js  
    │   └── product.controller.js 
    ├── routes/                 
    │   ├── user.routes.js      
    │   └── product.routes.js   
    └── ...
```

In this approach, you group files by their type, regardless of which feature they relate to. This might be easier to start with, especially for smaller projects.

### Code Modularity <a href="#code-modularity" id="code-modularity"></a>

Modularity is key to a maintainable codebase. Whether you’re dealing with the Angular frontend or the Express backend, make sure you break down your code into smaller, reusable pieces. Using design patterns like MVC (Model-View-Controller) for the backend and components and services in Angular can be really helpful.

#### Example: Modular Express Route

Copy

```
    // user.routes.js
    // Import the necessary modules
    const express = require('express');
    const userController = require('./user.controller');
    
    // Create an Express router object
    const router = express.Router();
    
    // Define routes and attach controller methods
    router.get('/', userController.getAllUsers);
    router.get('/:id', userController.getUserById);
    router.post('/', userController.createUser);
    
    // Export the router
    module.exports = router;
```

### Environment Configuration <a href="#environment-configuration" id="environment-configuration"></a>

Always externalize configuration details like database URIs, API keys, and environment-specific settings. Use environment variables or dedicated configuration files to manage these settings.

Copy

```
    // config.js
    // External configuration
    module.exports = {
      PORT: process.env.PORT || 3000,
      DB_URI: process.env.DB_URI || 'mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp',
      // ... other settings
    };
```

### Version Control <a href="#version-control" id="version-control"></a>

Always use a version control system like Git to manage your source code. Adopt a Git branching strategy that suits your development workflow. This not only serves as a backup for your code but also makes collaboration among team members smoother.

* **Configuring Environment Variables**:Set environment variables in your capsule settings. This is crucial for database connections and other configuration details.
*   **Uploading Code and Dependencies**:Use Code Capsules’ interface to upload your project code or connect to your GitHub repository.

    Ensure that all dependencies are specified in your `package.json` files for both front-end and back-end.
*   **Launching the Capsules**:Once configured, launch your capsules. Code Capsules will build and deploy your application.

    Monitor the deployment process and check logs for any potential issues.
*   **Testing and Verifying Deployment**:After deployment, test your application to ensure it’s running correctly.

    Verify both the front-end and back-end functionalities.

#### Final Steps

*   **Updating and Maintenance**:For updates, push changes to your repository or re-upload the updated code.

    Regularly monitor the performance and logs to maintain your application.
